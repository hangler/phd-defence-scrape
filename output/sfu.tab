For a graph G(V,E), The subset of V(G),D, is a dominating set of G if each vertex v of G is either in D or has a neighbour in D. Finding a minimum dominating set for arbitrary graphs is NP-hard and remains NP-hard for planar graphs. Recently, based on the notion of branch-decompositions, there has been significant theoretical progress towards fixed-parameter algorithms and polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for the problem in planar graphs. However, little is known on the practical performances of those algorithms and a major hurdle for such evaluations is lack of efficient tools for computing branch-decompositions of input graphs. We develop efficient implementations of algorithms for computing optimal branch-decompositions of planar graphs. Based on these tools, we perform computational studies on a fixed-parameter exact algorithm and a PTAS for the DOMINATING SET problem in planar graphs. Our studies show that the fixed parameter exact algorithm is practical for graphs with small branchwidth and the PTAS is an efficient alternative for graphs with large branchwidth. We also perform analytical and computational studies for a branch-decomposition based fixed parameter exact algorithm for the CONNECTED DOMINATING SET (CDS) problem in planar graphs. We prove a better upper bound for the branchwidth in terms of the minimum size of CDS. Using this improved upper bound, we achieve an improved time complexity for the exact algorithm for the CDS problem. Finally, we show that the density of the CDS problem in planar graphs is 1/2.2 in bidimensionality theorem.

Is there a regular pattern in the arrangement of data? Are there periodic recurrences in a given sequence? Is there a repetition in a series of data items? These are classical problems with broad applications in various areas of computer science. Inspired by the rise of interest in sublinear computation in the past two decades, this thesis examines these questions in the context of the data stream model where the input is accessed in sequential manner and there are strict memory limitations. In specific, we study algorithms for Measures of sortedness. In this category, we study the problem of approximating the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a stream, and its dual problem, known as distance to monotonicity where we estimate the number of necessary deletions to make a sequence sorted. Measures of regularity. We study detecting periodicity and estimating closedness to periodicity in time-series data streams. Finding duplicates. In contrast to periodicity which concerns consecutive repetitions, we study standard notion of repetition as well and give algorithms for reporting a duplicate. Free Event 	Simon Fraser University

This is possible due to the diffusion of hydrogen atoms within water molecules in the imaging body; thus capturing the microstructure of the underlying tissues. DW-MRI adds to conventional MRI the capability of measuring this diffusion of water molecules by applying strong magnetic field along several gradient directions in order to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient along those directions. In this thesis, we look at modeling diffusion of water molecules with Cartesian Tensors: a model known as Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). We begin with second order tensor model which results in an image where at each voxel the preferred direction of water diffusion is locally modeled by a second order 3x3 symmetric positive definite matrix whose coefficients are estimated from the DW-MR data. After briefly reviewing anisotropy and similarity measures of second order tensors, we extend these ideas to develop a novel anisotropy measure. Tensor similarity measures are then used to extend scalar image segmentation algorithms in order to segment tensor images. Next, we look at fiber tractography, a mechanism to non-invasively study the three-dimensional architecture of white matter tracts in the central nervous system, and develop an adaptive seeding algorithm using tensor similarity measures. The concept of fiber tractography is then used for clinical application to investigate various features of white matter fiber tracts extracted from DT-MR images in the cortico-striatal region of the brain in control and Parkinson's disease subjects. Finally, we investigate the limitations of second order tensor model and extend the model to higher order tensors in order to correctly depict crossing, fanning, splitting and merging fiber tracts. In particular, we develop a new technique to model fiber orientation distribution functions using higher order tensors. In attempting to extend the rich set of algorithms developed for second order tensors, we also derive a new anisotropy measure derived directly from fiber orientation distribution functions.

I use a probit model with educational enrolment as the dependent variable run separately for boys and girls. I find evidence of a negative effect of parental migration on children’s school enrolment. The negative effect of parental migration is larger on the school enrolment of boys than on girls’. Also, the longer the father’s absence is, the bigger the negative impact on rural boys’ enrolment. The effect of parental migration is robust to the use of instrumental variable analysis, and the effect of migratory duration is robust to the use of a different definition of migratory duration.Land Tenure versus Land Redistribution in ChinaAfter the land policy reform in China, the central government introduced land tenure policy. However, periodical farmland redistributions can be found in almost every village having been studied. This paper sets up a theoretical model trying to investigate this puzzle and study the policy implication on long-run investment. I propose a limited liability model of land tenancy in an overlapping generations setting. Three land tenure scenarios are studied: no farmland redistribution (strict land tenure), land redistribution according to demographic changes only, and land redistribution based on both demographic changes and farming failure. The model implies that without soundly established insurance institutions and farmland rental market and stable off-farm job opportunities, individual farming households may be better off under a land redistribution regime. Especially the households with more children prefer the land redistribution regimes. In terms of long-run investment, redistribution according to demographic changes discourages long-term investment, yet redistribution based on farming failure may mitigate the negative effect of redistribution on long-run investment. The model is consistent with the empirical evidence.Generalists, Specialists: Who Get to the TopThis paper tries to analyze the three aspects of organizational hierarchy: (1) generalists or specialists: which should get to the top?  (2) How many agents should get to the top?  (3) Can the agents who should be at the top in the optimal hierarchy really get to the top?  Using a T-period model with promotion, the paper finds that the optimal hierarchy form depends on the size of the externality of coordinating multiple assets by generalists.  How many agents should be at the top depends on the elasticity of the externality of coordinating multiple assets.  Finally, promotion opportunity gives agents who should at the top more incentive to exert effort, and thus are more likely to get promoted.	Simon Fraser University

In order to understand replication in eukaryotes, one needs to know not only how the replicative machineries function on the molecular level but also how the machineries are organized genome wide to ensure complete duplication. Over the past fifteen years, advances in technology have allowed researchers to perform genome-wide experiments that probe the state of replication in many organisms. These datasets make possible quantitative modelling of the replication process. The kinetics of DNA replication is formally analogous to a physical phase-transformation process. In replication, the DNA is transformed from a "non-replicated" phase to a "replicated" phase, just as freezing water is transformed from a liquid phase to a solid phase. Using this analogy, we map the replication process onto a stochastic nucleation-and-growth model introduced in statistical physics to describe first-order phase transitions. Extending the model, we develop a mathematical framework that is flexible enough to describe the kinetics of replication in eukaryotes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our theory to three applications. In the first, we apply the theory to a recent dataset on budding yeast to extract its genome-wide replication program. Based on this study, we give the first proposal to explain how the temporal aspect of the replication program can be controlled mechanistically. In the second application, we address the "random-completion problem," which asks how replication-completion times can be controlled when replication starts at random places and times. We find that the strategy adopted in frog embryos to solve the problem also nearly minimizes the use of certain replicative machineries. In the last application, we study possible ways to extract information from a popular technique used to probe replication in multicelular eukaryotes ranging from worms to humans. We show some preliminary results that can be extended to real experiments in the near future. Examining Committee Chair: J.

There have been two main threads in the literature for solving this problem -- one focusing on designing more discriminative representation of the input and another one focusing on designing flexible mapping functions.Interestingly, for many applications, the outputs follow a structure, which can be exploited to narrow down the space of possible (most likely) outputs and consequently boost the overall mapping performance. Applications with this property include object detection (computer vision), object category segmentation (computer vision), parsing (natural language processing), etc.Current algorithms for learning the parameters of the model in structured prediction iteratively find the most confusing output configuration – the configuration that receives high score according to the model, but is very different from the ground truth output -- and update the model parameters to suppress its score. Here, finding the most confusing configuration is the most expensive procedure in learning.In this thesis we propose two algorithms for approximately finding the most confusing configuration when the model is a Markov network. Each algorithm works for a large group of non-decomposable performance measures that arise in many real-world applications.We first design a baseline that achieves state-of-the-art results in our main application of object category segmentation on person class by introducing fine and coarse clothing texture cues as a set of new features.Then, we propose our first algorithm that approximates the non-decomposable loss function in false positive and false negative space with a piecewise planar function and finds the most confusing output in each piece.Our second proposed algorithm decomposes the dual of the objective into a supermodular Markov random field and the loss function augmented with a linear term -- both being efficient to optimize.We empirically show the superiority of the two proposed algorithms over our baseline and another strong baseline -- both used widely in the literature -- on two main applications, object category segmentation (on PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010 and H3D datasets) and action retrieval (on our nursing home dataset).Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Greg Mori, Co-Senior SupervisorDr. Ze-Nian Li, Co-Senior SupervisorDr. Anoop Sarkar, Internal ExaminerDr. Ben Taskar, External ExaminerDr. Brian Funt, ChairFree Event	Simon Fraser University

It is well suited for measuring the very small magnetic fields generated by neuronal brain activity as well as any small varying magnetic fields. MEG is a versatile tool with untapped potential. It is emerging as a particularly powerful modality for the analysis of the typical and atypical brain’s functional connectivity dynamics across 5 dimensions, including the brain network’s oscillation dynamics and correlations across frequency and time. This thesis explores three aspects of MEG: instrumentation, application, and new directions. The clinical relevance was expanded with the development and demonstration of a phantom source as a device ground truth to help with standardization of the instrument as a clinical tool. A portable magnetic dipole phantom with a constant current generator was developed that can be independently driven without reliance on system specific hardware. Data was collected from several MEG laboratories using this phantom to study variability between machines at different sites and from different manufacturers. Extending the phantom design to a multi-dipole model, a potential ground truth for MEG source imaging was developed. Methods developed to model and localize the magnetic dipoles showed high and consistent accuracy well within the 2-3 mm spatial resolution expected from MEG. Inverse analysis of MEG data for dipole and beamformer strategies were studied and applied specifically to the properties and neural generators for facial processing. Event-related activity between the perception of face and non-face object stimuli appears as a difference in amplitude between the two conditions peaking around 170 ms over the posterior regions of electroencephalography scalp recordings (N170) and MEG sensor recordings (M170). The peak is larger for face than non-face stimuli and typically greater in the right hemisphere. The anatomic origins of this face-selective 170 ms peak remains unresolved. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed a core facial network involving the facial fusiform area (FFA), occipital facial area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). It has been proposed that the M170 peak may originate from the FFA, STS, or both. MEG data from five different face-processing studies were analyzed and compared. The results confirmed the paradigms are sensitive to the M170 peak and is modulated by changes in the presentation of the visual stimuli such as changing spatial frequency, emotion and dynamic versus static images. Equivalent dipole analysis of individual participant recordings required 1 to 3 pairs of bilateral dipoles in the posterior regions to model the M170 peak, representing the locations of the FFA, OFA and STS. Event-related beamformer results also revealed a similar network. In both the beamformer and dipole results, the FFA accounted for a larger portion of the M170 signal than the OFA and STS but all three were needed in some cases to model the individual subject data. Finally, a novel technique was developed to extend the usage of MEG for magnetic nanoparticle imaging. There is potential to utilize the magnetic properties of these particles for internal imaging of living organisms using MEG. Stationary samples of magnetic nanoparticles in liquid suspensions were measured within the MEG helmet. While the net effect was difficult to detect in the time domain, they appeared as a distinct increase in baseline noise in the frequency domain - highest in the low frequencies and decaying to below the noise floor above 500 Hz. Bandwidths of up to 4000 Hz were studied. A method using beamformers to localize these particles using this rise in frequency rather than time provided a robust technique for the potential localization of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo and offers better signal to noise constraints for future applications.

I analyse some of the immediate causes for wage differentials across workers and wage patterns for the same worker over time. Since we find that in order to understand poverty and intergenerational wage inequality for marginalized groups we need to look at academic achievement in early schooling, I also investigate the possible role of targeted funding for specific educational goals on reading achievement. The first chapter focuses on the effect of industry experience on wages. I estimate a simultaneous equation model using a large panel of Italian workers for the years 1986-2004. Results show that wage returns to industry experience are much higher than wage returns to job seniority, and that returns to general labour market experience dominate the effects of both industry experience and job tenure. The second chapter investigates the effect of coworker characteristics on wages. The effect of interest is identified from within-firm changes in workforce composition, controlling for person effects, firm effects, and sector-specific time trends. My estimates are based on a very large linked employer employee dataset of workers and firms from the Italian region of Veneto for the years 1982-2001. I find that a 10-percent increase in the average labour market value of coworker skills is associated with a 3.6 percent wage premium. Decomposing the immigrant wage gap shows that between 10 and 15 percent of the immigrant wage gap can be explained by differences in coworker characteristics. The last chapter of this thesis investigates the effects of providing school districts with supplemental funding to support the language development of students who speak a non-standard English dialect. In practice, the students funded under this policy are almost exclusively students who also self-report Aboriginal identity. Exploiting the staggered uptake of this funding across school districts in British Columbia we find that the policy substantially improved the reading scores of Aboriginal students.

The first chapter is focused on the economics of gender, and the other two chapters are focused on the economics of education. The first chapter examines whether women face an economy-wide glass ceiling in the labour market. The existence of an economy-wide glass ceiling would imply that females are under-represented in high wage regions of the wage distribution, and their under-representation becomes more pronounced as we up the wage distribution. I also measure the extent to which the economy-wide glass ceiling comes about because women are segregated into lower-paying firms (glass doors), or because they are segregated into lower-paying jobs within firms (within-firm glass ceilings), compared to their male counterparts. I find clear evidence that women experience an economy-wide glass ceiling that is driven mainly by their disproportionate sorting across firm types rather than sorting across jobs within firms. I find no evidence that gender differences in sorting across firms can be accounted for by compensating differentials. However, my results are consistent with predictions of an efficiency wage model where high-paying firms discriminate against females. The second chapter estimates the effect of publicly-disseminated information about school achievement on school choice decisions. We find that students are more likely to leave their school when public information reveals poor school-level performance. Some parents’ school choice decisions respond to information soon after it becomes available. Others, including non-English-speaking parents, alter their school choice decisions only in response to information that has been disseminated widely and discussed in the media. Parents in low-income neighbourhoods are most likely to alter their school choice decisions in response to new information. The third chapter measures the extent to which cross-sectional differences in schools’ average achievement on standardized tests are due to transitory factors. Test-based measures of school performance are increasingly used to shape education policy, and recent evidence shows that they also affect families’ school choice decisions. There are, however, concerns about the precision of these measures. My results suggest that sampling variation and one-time mean reverting shocks are a significant source of cross-sectional variation in schools’ mean test scores. 	Simon Fraser University

Extensive research works have been conducted to understand them in the recent years. However, a number of new features emerge and a number of directions are yet to be explored.This thesis largely extends the current research efforts on social media content distribution by measurements and enhancements. We first analyze YouTube Insight dataset from a partner's view, revealing the inherent relationship among various metrics which affect the popularity of the videos. Our findings facilitate YouTube partners to adapt their content deployment and user engagement strategies togenerate more views and subsequently increasing their revenues. We also take an important step towards understanding the characteristics of video spreading in social media, examining the user behaviour and the spreading structure. We propose an epidemic model to capture the process of video spreading, which serves as a valuable tool for workload synthesis, traffic prediction, and resource provisioning.Motivate by our measurement and a user questionnaire survey, we reveal a new scenario of coexistence of sharing and streaming. We propose a novel system that leverages stable storage users and yet inherently prioritizes living streaming flows, providing better scalability, robustness, and streaming quality. On the other hand, the recent emerged cloud service is a promising solution to the huge demands ofbandwidth and storage from the growing social media. However the existing works on partitioning social media contents only focus on preserving the social relationship. We take an important factor, user access pattern, into account, and formulate the problem as a constrained k-medoids clustering problem. Our solution shows significant decrease of the access deviation and flexible preservation of the social relationship.Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Jiangchuan Liu, Senior SupervisorDr. Jian Pei, SupervisorDr. Ivan Bajic, Internal ExaminerDr. Jianping Pan, External ExaminerDr. Pavol Hell, Chair	Simon Fraser University

The research proceeds along five chapters. The first chapter develops a Hausman-type specification test statistic for conditional moment restrictions (CMR) models. These models cover one of the largest ranges in empirical studies, including, for instance, regression models, simultaneous equations models, and models of optimizing economic agents under uncertainty. The proposed test statistic is asymptotically chi-squared distributed under correct specification. A general bootstrap procedure for computing critical values in small samples where asymptotics may fail is also proposed. The test statistic is easy to implement and simulations show that it works well in small samples. The second and third chapters develop third-order likelihood based procedures for estimation and inference in small sample models. Chapter two proposes a statistical technique to derive highly accurate p-value approximations when testing for autocorrelation in dynamic nonlinear regression models. The proposed techniques are particularly accurate for small samples whereas commonly used methods can be misleading. Two Monte Carlo simulations are provided to show how the proposed method outperforms existing ones and an empirical example applied to population census data is given to illustrate their implementation and usefulness in practice. Likewise, Chapter three uses similar techniques to develop a procedure to obtain highly accurate confidence interval estimates for the functional R = P(X > Y ) where X and Y are data from independent normal distributions of unknown means and variances with only few observations. The proposed method is compared to existing ones and its supreme accuracy in terms of coverage probability and error rate is confirmed by numerical simulations. The fourth and fifth chapters examine entrepreneurship and occupational choices in Africa. The fourth chapter investigates how skills and limited access to credit influence occupational patterns and explain the extreme heterogeneity observed in the informal sector of developing countries using structural, reduced form and nonparametric techniques over a cross-sectional sample of households from the Cameroon informal sector. Structural estimates and counterfactual numerical simulations are then used to show that microfinance can improve the operational efficiency of the informal sector and strengthen its income-enhancing effects on the urban poor. The fifth chapter, however, argues that in the African context, obstacles hindering entrepreneurship are not only limited to access to credit or availability of skills. In the absence of a public safety net, Africans have developed a culture of "forced mutual help" (Firth 1951) that obliges them to share their resources with their needy relatives and extended family. Since becoming an entrepreneur marks economic success, it inevitably involves substantial family taxation. The study combines theoretical and empirical analysis to show how the mutual help constraint influences entrepreneurship and adversely effects the growth of the African formal economy, using a database compiling enterprises surveys from several African countries.

It was first fabricated in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov allowing experiments that were initially thought impossible. Although graphene is a semi-metal, electronic applications require knowledge regarding how to change its phase from a semi-metal to an insulator. For spinless fermions on graphene, density imbalance, coupling between its Dirac points, and directed next nearest neighbor hopping can lead to charge density wave, Kekule bond density wave, and quantum hall effect insulating phases. Furthermore, topological defects such as line defects and vortices allow bound-state solutions within the gap giving rise to fractional charge. Another example where a Dirac linear dispersion is found is spinless fermions on the Lieb lattice. At one-third filling, the Lieb lattice is a semi-metal. Density imbalance, staggered nearest neighbour hopping, and directed next nearest neighbor hopping can change this lattice from semimetal to an insulating phase characterized by a charge density wave, staggered hopping, broken pi/2 rotation symmetry, or broken time reversal symmetry. In both graphene and Lieb lattice, by adding and adjusting the strengths of nearest and next nearest neighbour interactions, many of these interesting phases can be energetically favourable in mean-field theory.

Steven DodgeCHIRAL SYMMETRY BREAKING IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTORS AND BIREFRINGENT COLD ATOMS, HELICITY MODULUS IN LAYERED BOSONS AND PHASE DIAGRAM OF SUPERCONDUCTOR-INSULATOR TRANSITIONThis work is a compilation of different research projects which has been done during the years. The main theme of this thesis, however, is the high-temperature superconductivity. In Chapter 1 we carefully proceed to construct the field theory of underdoped cuprates beginning with a well-defined d-wave superconductor and adding the vortex degree of freedom using a singular gauge transformation. The symmetries of the theory both in the presence and absence of a quasiparticle mass are a main focus of this Chapter. Nodal quasi-particles is known to obey relativistic Lorentz symmetry while their massless nature represent another symmetry which we will identify as a chiral SU(2) symmetry. It is shown that 2+1 quantum electrodynamics is the effective theory the describes underdoped cuprates in the zero-temperature pseudogap regime. In Chapter 2, we focus on the mechanism of the dynamical mass generation in three dimensional quantum electrodynamics and theories with four-fermion interactions. This is a field that has been subject of extensive research in last two decades. However, our momentum-shell renormalization group approach is new to the field and through that we are able to estimate the conditions for the mass generation mechanism and also work out the phase diagram of the theory for charge and interaction strength. We devote the rest of Chapter 2 to discuss the applications of momentum-shell renormalization group to other four-fermionic theories in the absence of a gauge field. The justification for this is the fact that in the superconducting regime the system can be described by a massive gauge field theory coupled to relativistic quasi-particles which effectively represent a four-fermionic theory. Inspired by the field theory constructed in Chapter 1, in Chapters 3 and 4 we discuss the superfluid response of the underdoped materials using an anisotropic bosonic model and compare it to the experiment. The original idea is to see how the c-axis superfluid density measurements can help one to set the parameters in our original field theory for underdoped cuprates. The behaviours of the superfluid responses in both out-of-plane and in-plane has been detailed as a function of temperature and density (doping) and is shown there is disagreement for measured c-axis response using bosonic-only Hamiltonian conjectured. Discussions on the limitations of the layered bosonic model to explain the superfluid response of a underdoped cuprate is detailed at the end of Chapter 4. The next two Chapters, Chapters 5 and 6 are somewhat diversions of the subject of high-temperature superconductivity. Chapter 5 which is based on a paper I collaborated with M. Kennett and N. Komeilizadeh, discusses similar features of broken chiral symmetry in context of fermions in optical lattices. The particular model which is constructed in Chapter 5 represents broken chiral symmetry for relativistic quasi-particles. However, the mechanism of symmetry breaking is different from dynamical mass generation. Effect of different staggered potentials and Hubbard interaction on this model is briefly discussed. Chapter 6 is an original work of the author with I.F. Herbut on Superconductor- Insulator transition (SI) in the context of low-dimensional disordered systems. We construct a bosonic theory for a conventional BCS superconductor in the presence of quenched disorder and show that in thephase diagram of the theory the phase-disordered Bose Glass phase, survives in arbitrary weakdisorder and interaction strengths. The general feature of such SI transitions is very similar to high temperature superconductors in pseudogap regime. The main difference is the absence of nodal quasi-particles and relativistic invariance that follows from their gapless nature. 	Simon Fraser University

However, a physical explanation of its origin is still missing. While the cosmological constant, Lambda, is the favorite candidate, a multitude of other theories have been proposed. Rather than testing every theory against data, one can adapt phenomenological approaches aimed at testing Lambda.Adopting a model-independent approach to studying dark energy, we have investigated the utility of wavelets for constraining the redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state, w(z), from a combination of the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscilation (BAO) data. We have shown that sharp deviations from w= -1 can be detected efficiently in the future SNe Ia data. Applying this method to the "Constitution" SNe Ia data, combined with the CMB data from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and BAO data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), provided only weak hints of dark energy dynamics.Future weak lensing surveys will have the ability to measure the growth of large scale structure with accuracy sufficient for discriminating between different theories of dark energy and modified gravity (MG). The growth of structure can be tested, in a model-independent way, by parametrizing the evolution equations of cosmological perturbations. At the linear level, this can be achieved by introducing two scale- and time-dependent functions (MG functions). We have consistently implemented the parametrized equations in the commonly used public codes, CAMB and CosmoMC, while preserving the covariant conservation of the energy-momentum. As a demonstration, we have obtained joint constraints on the neutrino mass and parameters of a scalar-tensor gravity model from the CMB, SNe Ia and the correlation of CMB with large scale structure.We have performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find the eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the forecasted covariance matrix of the MG functions for surveys like Dark Energy Survey and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. By examining the eigenmodes, we can learn about the scales and redshifts where the surveys are most sensitive to modification of the growth. We have considered the impact of some of the systematic effects expected in weak lensing surveys. Also, we have demonstrated the utility of the PCA as an efficient way of storing information about the linear growth of perturbations.Finally, we have analyzed the degeneracy between the MG functions and other cosmological parameters, paying special attention to the effective equation of state w(z). We have taken several models with different MG parametrizations and studied their merits. We have shown how the complementarity of different observables helps break the degeneracies.EXAMINING COMMITTEEChair: Eldon EmberlySenior Supervisor: Levon PogosianSupervisor: Andrei FrolovSupervisor: Howard TrottierSFU Examiner: Dugan O'NeilExternal Examiner: Kris Sigurdson, University of British Columbia	Simon Fraser University

Exergames (encouraging players to be physically active through game play) are proposed as one means of encouraging inactive individuals to be active. The Wii Fitness Study tracked physical activity by midlife and older women after they were asked to play the commercially-produced exergame Wii Fit Plus as part of their overall program of physical activity. Thirty participants (ages 40-79) were tracked for three to six months. The data was collected and analyzed based on Kathy Charmaz' constructivist grounded theory approach. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, self-reported weekly minutes of activity, Wii console data, and previously validated fitness tests for aerobic endurance, lower body strength, and standing balance. The interviews and fitness tests were conducted at the beginning, mid-point, and conclusion of the study. Unlike traditional approaches, the numerical and textual data were compared using the constant comparative method of qualitative analysis.The frequency of Wii Fit Plus use was determined by the participants. While older and more sedentary players used the exergame throughout the study period, younger and more active participants preferred vigorous-intensity outdoor activities to indoor monitor-based play. For participants whose balance was poor earlier in the study, regular use of Wii Fit Plus improved their ability to stand one-legged. Wii Fit Plus balance games helped women over age fifty-four to determine that many of them could retrain their balancing ability. To participants who had been previously sedentary, the moderate-intensity forms of activity offered by Wii Fit Plus appeared optimal, and success playing the game encouraged those participants to continue their positive exercise experience.Participants wanted to remain ‘fit for life’, sustaining physical activity in multiple locations using diverse individualized approaches. This study has provided both reasons and evidence suggesting that exergame designers might usefully exhibit the same level of functional creativity as cell phone designers have done. Only then can the exergame become a vital part of an overall program of physical activity, equipping many more of us with the confidence and competence to become, and to remain, fit for life.

First, the effects of Landau level mixing on charge density wave (CDW) formation in quantum Hall systems is studied. It is shown that the tendency towards CDW formation in quantum Hall systems survives in the presence of Landau level mixing. A Landau free energy theory is then developed using the Hartree-Fock approximation to describe the possible CDW states that may arise when mixing is strong enough to bring two energy levels near degeneracy. The possible orderings that can take place for the specific example of Rashba spin-orbit coupling as a basis for Landau level mixing are then considered. Second, the effect of disorder on quantities reflecting superconducting tendencies in the checkerboard Hubbard model is studied using exact diagonalization calculations. The results suggest that spatial modulations in the hopping parameters of the Hubbard model lead to a robustness to disorder for $d$-wave superconductivity. Third, a tight-binding model whose low energy excitations are relativistic fermions with two different Fermi velocities is introduced. It is shown numerically that these birefringent fermions have the novel property that there exist fractionalized zero-modes that break vortex-anti-vortex symmetry for an appropriately chosen topological defect. In each system, spatial modulations in the real-space properties of the system have a non-trivial effect on the observed physics.

In magnetic trilayer systems of the form ferromagnetic/non-ferromagnetic/ferromagnatic the magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic ?lm are locked together by exchange coupling through the non-magnetic spacer layer. The magnetic behaviour in these systems - the magnetic anisotropy and interlayer coupling - is strongly dependent on the thickness of the layers, the nature of the interface between layers, the strain in the layers and the extent of any interdi?usion or reaction between layers and substrate. Understanding the structure is a critical component of developing the correct interpretation of the magnetic behaviour.The Molecular Beam Epitaxy facility, MBE-1, was developed for use on the undulator beamline of the Paci?c Northwest Consortium Collaborative Access Team at the AdvancedPhoton Source to permit in situ epitaxial growth of metal ?lms and their structural characterization by synchrotron radiation techniques. In this thesis it was used to characterize iron/palladium/iron on the GaAs(001) trilayer system. Three categories of samples were prepared and examined in situ. Iron ?lms were deposited on the 4?6-reconstructed surface of GaAs(001) with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 38.5 monolayers. Palladium ?lms were deposited on iron as follows: 1 monolayer palladium on 9 monolayers of iron, and 3.5 and 7 monolayers palladium on 24 and 38.5 monolayers of iron. Finally, iron ?lms 4 and 10 monolayers thick were deposited on 7 monolayers of palladium.The polarization-dependent X-ray absorption ?ne structure (XAFS) technique in total reflection mode was employed to examine the samples and compare in-plane to out-of-plane structure in these ?lms. This technique allows to extract nearest neighbour radial distances, coordination numbers and mean square relative displacement to characterize theprobed system, while being sensitive to the atomic species of both absorber and scatterer.Iron and palladium K-edge spectra were obtained both above and below the critical angle for total reflection. Near 4 monolayers for iron ?lms on GaAs(001), a transition fromisland to layer-by-layer growth modes is accompanied by the observation of a distortion of the iron to a body-centered tetragonal structure (as compared to bulk body-centered cubic iron) with a c=a ratio of 1.030(8), with no thickness dependence observed to 38.5 monolayers. The intermediate palladium layer shows distortion from its natural face-centered cubic structure to face-centered tetragonal structure. Alloying at the interface with the underlying iron is restricted to a depth of 0.5-1.0 monolayers. The upper layer of iron shows tetragonal distortion similar to the layers of iron grown on GaAs(001)-4?6. There is also evidence of alloy formation at the interface involving the underlying palladium with the thickness of the alloy region being 2-2.5 monolayers.Examining CommitteeChair: Dr. J.

Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. However, collaborative filtering based approaches perform poorly for so-called cold start users. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this research we propose novel methods to address the recommendation problem in online social networks. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of user behavior in a social network, we first propose a model to capture the temporal dynamics of user behavior based on different effects influencing the behavior of users in rating items and creating social relations (e.g. social influence, social selection and transitivity of relations). Then we propose a memory based approach based on random walk models to perform recommendation in social networks. Matrix factorization is the most prominent model based approach for collaborative recommendation. We extend matrix factorization and propose a model that takes into account the social network as well as the rating matrix. Finally, we present a mixed membership community based model for recommendation in social networks based on stochastic block models. This model is capable of performing both rating and link prediction. All methods have been experimentally evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on real life data sets from Epinions.com, Flixster.com and Flickr.com. The Flixster data set has been crawled and published as part of the research during this thesis. Experimental results show that our proposed models achieve substantial quality gains compared to the existing methods.

Relational data consists of different types of objects where each object is characterized with a dierent set of attributes. The structure of relational data presents an opportunity for objects to carry additional information via their links and enables the model to show correlations among objects and their relationships. This dissertation focuses on learning graphical models for such data. Learning graphical models for relational data is much more challenging than learning graphical models for propositional data. One of the challenges of learning graphical models for relational data is that relational data, unlike propositional data, is non Independent and identically distributed and cannot be viewed in a single table. Relational data can be modeled using a graph, where objects are the nodes and relationships between the objects are the edges. In this graph, there may be multiple edges between two nodes because objects may have dierent types of relationships with each other. The existence of multiple paths of different length among objects makes the learning procedure much harder than learning from a single table. We use a lattice search approach with lifted learning to deal with the multiple path problem. My dissertation focuses on learning the structure of Markov Logic Networks, which are a first order extension of Markov Random Fields. Our approach combines the scalability and efficiency of learning in directed relational models, and the inference power and theoretical foundations of undirected relational models. We utilize Parametrized Bayes nets, an extension of Bayesian networks based on first order logic, for learning class-level or first-order dependencies, which model the general database statistics over attributes of linked objects and their links. We then convert the Parametrized Bayes net to a Markov Logic Network using the standard moralization procedure (marry spouses, omit edge directions). Experimental results indicate that our methods are two orders of magnitude faster, and predictive metrics are superior or competitive with state-of-the-art Markov Logic Network learners on six benchmark datasets.

The first two papers use the same theoretical model to explain different issues in developing countries. The third paper studies the effects of population growth on the Environmental Kuznets Curve provided it exists.China's internal migration plays an important role in explaining its recent economic success. The first paper constructs a model of labor migration, focusing on the role of selection effects in determining labor market outcomes, and then calibrates it to quantify the effects of China's labor market reforms on its outputs and inequality. I show that the removal of internal migration restrictions benefits the economy as a whole, while exacerbating inequality within both rural and urban areas.   The second paper suggests that minimum wage policy may be beneficial for a transitional economy in which labor is migrating from rural areas to urban areas when positive moving costs occur. With a moving cost wedge a modestly binding minimum wage can cause relatively low productivity urban workers to be replaced by higher productivity rural migrants, and therefore increase aggregate output. To achieve the second best outcome, government shall fully compensate the moving costs for the marginal migrant workers who move from the rural industrial sector to the urban subsistence sector and a binding minimum wage shall be imposed on the urban workers but not the migrant workers in the urban industrial sector.The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis postulates an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and many local environmental health indicators. By using an overlapping generations (OLG) model, I focus on technological effects, where the properties of the existing pollution abatement technologies could generate the inverted U-shaped EKC and other forms of growth-pollution paths for the less advanced economies. Moreover, I examine the effects of population growth on the shape of the EKC, provided that it exists. Simulations indicate positive population growth raises the height of the EKC at every level of output per worker; thus, putting an extra burden on environment quality. Empirical evidence from China partially supports the results.	Simon Fraser University

This paper examines the linkage between observable macroeconomic variables andcredit rating transitions of U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). I specify afully-parametric, heterogeneous credit rating intensity model, then use maximum likelihoodand forward selection methods to determine the significant covariates and corresponding ratingtransition intensities over time. These estimated intensities are converted to transition prob-abilities over intervals by numerically solving simple forward differential equations. I use amodified exponential distributed model to generate rating transition replicate records to studytheir sample distributions.Major findings are that RMBS having different levels of risk have different statisticallysignificant covariates to which they are related and have quite different sample distributions.There is no evidence that rating agencies do not rate through the business cycle. RMBS in-vestors should be alert to the fact that AAA securities of different RMBS classes have differenttransition probabilities over time. Also, the transition probabilities generated from covariatesdata from 2007 forecast a sharp increase in the probability of credit downgrades for SubprimeRMBS after the 2007 crisis. Ratings data is from the Standard & Poors CreditPro StructuredFinance Database from 1978 to the second quarter of 2007.Keywords: Credit rating transitions, Residential mortgage-backed securities, Subprime crisis	Simon Fraser University

In this theoretical study, I show how inelastic tunneling spectroscopy experimentswith the help of theory are now capable of determining the unknown bonding geometries betweenthe molecule and electrodes, and thus resolving the long standing “contact problem" of molecularnanoelectronics. As an example I consider the propanedithiol (PDT) molecules bridging goldnanocontacts in the recent experiment of Hihath et al. [Nano Lett. 8, 1673 (2008)]. Based on abinitio density functional and semi-empirical calculations, I find the relaxed geometries and vibrationalmodes of extended molecules each consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting twogold nanoclusters and calculate their elastic conductances and inelastic tunneling spectra. Comparingmy results with the data of Hihath et al., I find that the most frequently realized conformationin the experiment was trans molecules top-site bonded to both electrodes. I identify the featuresobserved in the experimental inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) of these moleculesat phonon energies near 46, 40 and 42 meV and show the switching from the 42 meV vibrationalmode to the 46 meV mode observed in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans moleculesfrom top-bridge to top-site bonding geometries. I extend my study to evaluating the effect of thiolhydrogen atoms in molecular junctions and show how IETS can be used to monitor gold-thiol bondformation and the cleavage of the S-H bond during this process. For pairs of PDT molecules connectingthe gold electrodes in parallel, I find total elastic conductances close to twice those of singlemolecules bridging the contacts with similar bonding conformations and small splittings of the vibrationalmode energies for the modes that are the most sensitive to the molecule-electrode bondinggeometries. I also describe the dependence of the transport properties of alkanedithiols molecularjunctions on the length of the alkane chain.Examining CommitteeChair: J.

My research is based on interviews, conversations, and participant observation conducted in 2004 and 2005-2007 on the consumption of Ayurveda, a two thousand year indigenous medical system. Scholars who study indigenous medical and consumption tend to equate medications with medical system. However Ayurveda cannot be reduced to objects such as medications alone. Accordingly, I pursue what my urban middle-class interlocutors identified as “Ayurveda,” paying close attention to their therapeutic landscapes of health care. This medical practice is an extensive repertoire of knowledge that is enacted by a variety of informal and formal experts. I argue that consumption and health care practices cannot be suitably understood if one’s analysis is restricted to exchange in the formal market economy. I portray medical practice as an activity system rather than a mere assemblage of objects or technologies (p.508). I trace the materiality and relationships which enact Ayurveda across the spaces of the household, clinic, and expositions. The household is a site for consumption, but one that takes place along non-market pathways. Members use their domestic network to access various unofficial practitioners who provide medical resources such as remedies and knowledge. The clinic highlights series of activities and verbal narratives, which form the basis of treatment for its patients. Even as the clinic becomes more marketized, informal repertoires of knowledge continue to be produced both by the patients and practitioners in their quest for health. The expositions foreground Ayurveda as a mass-produced object while relying on tropes of nationhood and authenticity to simultaneously lend authority to the practice and allow it to benefit from the expanding health care market. These spaces are not self-enclosed; rather they are points of convergence for the objects and relationships which propagate Ayurveda. My project highlights the continued relevance of multiple institutions consisting not only of the market but also the state, family, and neighbourhood in enacting formal and informal health care practices for consumption.

In this thesis we introduce birefringent relativisticfermions, for which the chiral symmetry usually present for Dirac fermions is broken, andthere can be more than one Fermi velocity. We first introduce a lattice model of spinlessfermions that can arise from a scheme to introduce an artificial magnetic field for coldatoms. This model has an unusual Hofstadter-like spectra as a function of the flux perplaquette. When there is an average of half a flux quantum per plaquette, the model hasDirac points in its spectrum and exhibits low energy excitations with two different “speedsof light”, i.e. birefringent fermions. We investigate the effects of several perturbations onthe spectrum such as staggered potentials and topological defects and we study the orderedphases that can arise from interactions. We find that sufficiently strong nearest neighbourinteractions lead to a charge density wave phase but that next-nearest neighbour interactionsallow the possibility of other phases. We also study the response of birefringent fermionsto a magnetic field and discuss how both Landau levels and the Integer Quantum Hall effectfor regular Dirac fermions are modified for birefringent fermions.EXAMINING COMMITTEEChair: Dr. J.

SAXS and SANSmeasurements were used to investigate the phase separation and morphology of thepolymer at nano-scale lengthscales, and WAXS measurements were used to determine thedegree of the crystallinity of the polymer. We have developed a self-consistent morphologicalmodel for the studied system. In this model, dry samples consist of quasi-sphericalfluorous domains embedded in a continuous phase of partially sulfonated polystyrene. We wereable to characterize the size and spacing of the domains and also quantify the degree ofphase separation. Our analysis shows that crystallinity acts as a hindering factor in thephase separation of the fluorous domains. Moreover, we ?find that, generally, partiallysulfonated samples possess a less-developed phase separation than the unsulfonated or fullysulfonated samples. The morphology of the wet samples consists of fluorous domains aswell as quasi-spherical water-rich domains. We ?find that samples swell homogeneously atthe nano-scale level and that the swelling is consistent with water content measurementsfor these samples, as long as the water content is < 80% vol. We have also characterizedthe spherical water-rich domains of the samples and argue that these water-rich domainsare connected with nano-channels of water containing ionic acid groups. Our resultssuggest that conductivity of the membrane is proportional to the size of the sphericalwater-rich domains and to the water volume associated with each domain, but is inverselyproportional to the spacing between them.EXAMINING COMMITTEEChair: Dr. J.

First, we investigate the effects of bright pixels on several current colour constancy algorithms. Then we use bright pixels to extend the seminal Gamut Mapping Colour Constancy algorithm. Here we define the White-Patch Gamut as a new extension to this method, comprising the bright pixels of the image. This approach adds new constraints to the standard constraints and improved estimates. Motivated by the effect of bright pixels in illumination estimation, we go on to incorporate consideration of specular reflection per se, which tends to generate bright pixels. To this effect we present a new and effective physics-based colour constancy representation, called the Zeta-Image, which makes use of a novel log-relative-chromaticity planar constraint. This method is fast and requires no training or tunable parameters; moreover, and importantly, it can be useful for removing highlights. We then go on to present a new camera calibration method aimed at finding a straight-line locus, in a special colour feature space, that is traversed by daylights and approximately by specular points. The aim of the calibration is to enable recovering the colour of the illuminant. Finally, we address colour constancy in a novel approach by utilizing unsupervised learning of a model for each training surface in training images. We call this new method Exemplar-Based Colour Constancy. In this method, we find nearest-neighbour models for each test surface and estimate its illumination based on comparing the statistics of nearest-neighbour surfaces and the target surface. We also extend our method to overcome the multiple illuminant problem.

This large dataset allows for tests of thestandard model as well as searches for new physics. Two measurements arereported in this thesis. The first analysis is a test of the standardmodel and has resulted in the world’s most precise measurement of thetop quark pair production cross section for final states which include ahadronically decaying tau lepton. The second analysis uses the samedataset to search for a charged Higgs boson, also resulting in theworld’s best limits for the search channel.In the cross section measurement, 2.1 inverse femtobarns of ATLASproton-proton collision data is used to measure the top quark pairproduction cross section in events containing an isolated electron ormuon and a tau lepton decaying hadronically. After initial eventrequirements, the leading background comes from top quark pairs withjets faking tau leptons. A fit to a tau lepton identification variableis used to determine the signal yield. The measured cross section,186 ±13 (stat.) +20 -19 (syst.) ±7 (lumi.) pb, is in good agreement withthe standard model prediction.Several extensions to the standard model predict the existence of atleast one charged Higgs boson, H±. According to these extensions, thetop quark can decay into a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs bosonin addition to the standard model decay to a bottom quark and a W boson.In the second analysis, event yield ratios between different finalstates are measured using 4.6 inverse femtobarns of ATLAS data. This iscompared to simulation in order to search for a violation of leptonuniversality. This ratio-based method reduces the impact of systematicuncertainties in the analysis. No significant deviations from thestandard model predictions are observed. With the assumption that thecharged Higgs boson branching ratio to a tau lepton and a neutrino is100%, upper limits in the range 3.2%–4.4% can be placed on the top quarkto charged Higgs branching ratio for 90 ≤ mH±≤ 140 GeV. Aftercombination with results from a search for charged Higgs bosons indecays using the tau(had)+jets final state, upper limits on thisbranching ratio can be set in the range 0.8%–3.4%, for 90 ≤ mH±≤ 140 GeV.EXAMINING COMMITTEEChair: Dr. J.

Today the Web has become an excellent source of consumer opinions. However, as the volume of opinionated text is growing rapidly, it is getting impossible for users to read all reviews to make a good decision. Reading different and possibly even contradictory opinions written by different reviewers even make them more confused. In the same way, monitoring consumer opinions is getting harder for the manufactures and providers. These needs have inspired a new line of research on mining customer reviews, or opinion mining. Recently, opinion mining has emerged as an interesting new research direction due to the availability of a huge volume of user-generated content. Aspect-based opinion mining, is a relatively new sub-problem that attracted a great deal of attention in the last few years. Extracted aspects and estimated ratings clearly provides more detailed information for users to make decisions and for suppliers to monitor their consumers. In this thesis, we address the problem of aspect-based opinion mining and seek novel methods to improve limitations and weaknesses of current techniques. We first propose a method, called Opinion Digger, that takes advantages of syntactic patterns to improve the accuracy of frequency-based technique. We then move on to model-based approaches and and propose an LDA-based model, called ILDA, to jointly extract aspects and estimate their ratings. In our next work, we compare ILDA with a series of increasingly sophisticated LDA models representing the essence of the major published methods in the literature. A comprehensive evaluation of these models indicates that while ILDA works best for items with large number of reviews, it performs poorly when the size of the training dataset is small, i.e., for cold start items. The cold start problem is critical as in real-life data sets around 90% of items are cold start. We address this problem in our last work and propose a LDA-based model, called FLDA. It models items and reviewers by a set of latent factors and learns them using reviews of an item category. Experimental results on real life data sets show that FLDA achieve significant gain for cold start items compared to the state-of-the-art models.

The consumption per capita fell below thebenchmark in the short to medium run, but overcame this trend in the long run. The food priceincreases explain partially the consumer price inflation in China and, partially too, the observedaccumulation of foreign asset holdings. We demonstrate that restrictive policy interventions intoagricultural markets have harmed the development of China’s agricultural sector.Second, in contrast to the impact of increased food prices, raise in global prices forenergy commodities negatively influenced both the real economy and private incomes in China.Within the knocked down GDP growth, household consumption suffered the most significanthurt. We also find that energy prices were largely responsible for the domestic inflation in the lastdecade. While the economic growth rate has slowed down, the growth itself has continued:positive development rates of all economic indicators have maintained. This suggests the stronggrowth foundation of the China’s economy as well as it being equipped well enough to meet thechallenge of increased energy prices.Third, we found that the recent appreciation of nominal exchange rate of the yuan, theChinese national currency, has had contractionary effects on the economy and deepened incomeinequality. Nevertheless, it has appreciably helped to curb inflation and reduced externalimbalances. We argue that the yuan appreciation can serve as an effective inflation controlinstrument, which should be accompanied by proper social policies targeting income inequality.In general, China’s economy has proved to be strong enough to respond to globalchallenges. Most negative effects do not eliminate the positive growth rate, but slightly slow itdown. Provided proper policies, China has potential to continue its role as a leading power in theworld economy for the decades to come.Keywords: dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; economy of China; globalfood prices; global energy prices; exchange rate appreciation; economic optimization in GAMS	Simon Fraser University

It presents a systematic record of the processes, which led to the significant changes in Russian penal policy, resulting in an overhaul of its sanctions and sentencing system. Based on a documentary review and legal analysis, an historical record, beginning in the late 1990s and progressing to 2003, is laid out. The record systematically describes events in the policy, problem, and political stream as they related to the creation of a policy image of prison overcrowding and Russian sanctions and sentencing policy in need of reform. Specifically, in the policy stream, there was an emergence of interest in non-custodial sanctions and liberalization of sentencing rules as a long-term legislative solution that could constrain the growth of prison population. In the problem stream, the magnitude of the overcrowding crisis demanded more radical and lasting solutions to the problem. In the political stream, changes in political leadership echoed national demands for stability and order and led to further consolidation of political power by the President and Presidential Administration. The administration seized the opportunity to couple all three streams together and successfully created a policy image of sanctions and sentencing system in need of correction. Acting on behalf of the President, it was able to enact its vision of policy change with virtually no resistance from the closely controlled parliament. This research expands the applicability of Kingdon’s Multiple Streams Model beyond the scope of the public policy setting for which the model was originally designed (i.e., American public policy agenda-setting). It has confirmed the existence of all the domains of Kingdon’s Multiple Stream Model supporting the utility and value of the MSM in examining penal policies of polities with different political structures and regimes.

A Comparative Study of British Colonial Screen Policies in the Interwar Pacific:Hong Kong, Singapore and New ZealandDavid NewmanCommitteeChair – TBDCatherine Murray, Senior SupervisorDal Yong Jin, SupervisorJanet Wasko, Supervisor (University of Oregon)Colin Browne, Internal Examiner (Contemporary Arts, SFU)Richard Maltby, External Examiner (Flinders University)AbstractSet against a background of imperialism, this study uses a comparative approach to investigate government policies toward, and interventions in, the motion picture industry prior to 1942 in three former British territories —Hong Kong, Singapore (Straits Settlements) and New Zealand.This study is based primarily on government and industry documents preserved in archives spanning several countries, drawing on both political economy and new cinema history to provide both the underlying narrative and analysis. Although ‘new cinema’ history focuses on cinema as a commercial institution and the socio-cultural history of its audiences, this study suggests such a conceptualisation should be broadened to explicitly include the political system. The development of policies and regulatory frameworks for the industry defined the operational context and boundaries of the audience experience.The underlying political narrative in each locality is different. In Hong Kong, there was the lost opportunity of utilising local-language production to meet Imperial quota goals. Singapore presents the story of censorship and early attempts at multi-culturalism through social control. New Zealand events reveal a government attempting to use the motion picture industry for social control and to maintain a thoroughly British identity. What links the three cases together is the local governments’ struggle to balance satisfying the requirements of the Imperial government in London, and meeting the demands of both local audiences and of theatre owners dependent on Hollywood product.Each of these cases show the role in which governments played in shaping the viewing experience for audiences, both through explicit regulation such as censorship and cinema operating hours, as well as more hidden areas such as fire regulations, as well as the production and distribution of certain forms of motion picture. The study concludes that three broad policy imperatives explain the actions of governments in the motion picture industry: safety, both moral and physical; social control and development; and economic factors.The focus on the social-cultural context of the audience experience of cinema inherent in new cinema history is seen to provide an important dimension missing from political economy and its focus on structure and agency.Keywordsimperialism; motion pictures; new cinema history; government policy; comparative screen policy; colonial policy; political ecology; political economy of film; New Zealand; Hong Kong; Straits Settlements; Singapore; British Malaya.

I examine editorial content from medical journals as a discursive space in which professional norms are constituted. I draw on the works of Pierre Bourdieu in order to argue that doctors are enmeshed in a unique system of rewards that cannot be explained by an economic model based on profit. I investigate three crisis moments during which Canadian doctors faced accusations from the public, the media and the government for not acting with scientific and moral judgment. The first crisis moment I examine occurs in the nineteenth century when doctors faced a hostile government that refused them the right to govern all aspects of medicine. During this time, doctors drew on middle-class masculine codes of etiquette and their privileged access to university education in order to claim that they were learned gentlemen acting on behalf of the public. This claim was called into question during the 1950s-1960s, however, when the Canadian media shamed the medical profession for opposing the proposal for a universal health care system. In this second crisis moment, in order to restore their moral credibility, doctors upheld general practice and public health as humane forms of medicine and adopted media relations strategies aimed at improving their image. Opening the doors to the media created complications, however, as demonstrated in the third crisis moment when the editors at the top Canadian medical journal were fired in 2006. This event revealed that the supposedly pure intellectual space of medical science collides with media-market forces, professional politics and journalism in ways that have troubling ramifications for medical practice. My analysis of these crisis moments demonstrates that morality, objectivity and ethics are not fixed concepts but are rather shaped in relation to historical, social, cultural, political and economic factors. This dissertation extends ethical discussions in medicine to include the ways in which doctors define and communicate what it means to act with integrity in relation to the state, professional politics and the media.

The ?rst and third chapter focus on labor market outcomes of minority group members, while the second chapter focuses on the education. Chapter 1 deals with the relationship between sexual orientation, gender, partnership, and labor market outcomes. I suggest that if there are compensating di?erentials and a gender gap in potential wages, an income e?ect can lead partnered gay men to choose jobs with lower wages and higher amenities than partnered straight men. The same mechanism would lead partnered lesbians to lower amenity and higher wage jobs than part- nered straight women, and we would expect no di?erences in wages or amenities between singles. I present results on estimated wages and new data on stressfulness of one's working environment that are largely consistent with these predictions, and then I discuss possible alternative explanations for my ?ndings. Chapter 2 focuses on the e?ect of open enrollment policies on students' academic achievement. The introduction of open enrollment may improve student achievement by providing access to better schools and by increasing inter-school competition. We use mea- sures of the local scope for school choice and competition before and after the policy change to investigate its e?ect on test scores. We ?nd the policy's e?ect depends on the quality of public schools that are located in proximity to a students residence. Students who are already guaranteed access to the locally top-ranked school earn lower scores under open enrollment, while those who gain access to higher-ranked schools earn higher scores. All students experience a small positive e?ect from in- creased competition among public schools. Chapter 3 explores the role of initial housing conditions on labor outcomes of new immigrants to Canada. We focus on whether immigrants arranged housing before landing. Within the framework of a dual search model, this variable can be interpreted as capturing the opportunity cost of searching for a job. We ?nd that not pre-arranging housing is associated with temporary worse labor outcomes among unskilled immigrants. The remainder of the chapter is spent looking for evidence that these results are due to an unob- served variable that drives both housing arrangements as well as labor outcomes, but no such evidence is found.

Here, by studying and designing motors which use Brownian motion and track asymmetry to bias the direction of motion, I gained insight into the underlying principles by which such motors operate. "Molecular spiders" [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 12693 (2006), Nature 465, 206 (2010)] are one example of synthetic biomolecular walkers able to generate biased motion by coupling the chemical asymmetry arising from substrate binding and cleavage to bias their mechanical stepping. These DNA-based motors diffuse to their substrate track where productive binding between a molecular spider’s DNAzyme leg and a ssDNA substrate facilitates cleavage of the substrate. Once cleaved, the decreased binding affinity between the DNAzyme and resulting product allows the motor to diffuse along the track and form new interactions with uncleaved substrate molecules. To  investigate the origin of biased motion of molecular spiders, I have performed Monte Carlo simulations. Using my simulations, I also investigated their performance as molecular motors, and determined how to optimize their motor properties by modifying tunable experimental parameters  in spider design. These studies assisted us in the design and construction of a novel protein-based synthetic motor, the "Lawnmower", which uses a burnt–bridges type of mechanism, the same as spiders, to autonomously and diffusively move forward. The lawnmower has trypsin proteases as blades, linked to a quantum dot hub, that interact with a one-dimensional peptide substrate track via binding to and cleavage of the substrates. Experimentally, it is confirmed with kinetic assays that our lawnmower is an active motor and that there are an average number of 8 blades on each motor. I also outlined the synthesis and characterization of a highly modified DNA-peptide construct, which acts as the track for the lawnmower. For this, I employed PCR to generate a densely labeled DNA and click chemistry for peptide conjugation to the functionalized DNA. As an additional motors-related project, I present the synthesis of a long one-dimensional DNA track with periodically repeating elements that provide specific binding sites for the "Tumbleweed" molecular motor [HFSP J. 3, 204 (2009)].EXAMINING COMMITTEEChair: Dr. J.

Software modelling and simulation are innovative computational methods that provide alternative means of developing and testing theory relevant to policy decisions. Software modelling is capable of dealing with obstacles often encountered in traditional social science research, such as the difficulty of performing real-world experimentation. As a relatively new science, computational research in the social sciences faces significant challenges, both in terms of methodology and acceptance. However, there is great potential for computing to aid in the application of scientific thinking to the grave issues facing society. This is particularly true since technological advances and societal change continue to make our lives more complex. Policy decisions can have significant impacts in the lives of those affected; it is imperative we strive to develop novel and effective methods to inform these decisions. This thesis focuses on the interaction of modelling, software development, and experimentation in computational social science research pursued by small teams of interdisciplinary scientists. I present an innovative software development framework designed for this kind of research. By integrating software throughout the research process for both modelling and experimentation, and utilizing a flexible and iterative development model, my framework addresses many pressing issues of computational social science: uncertainty due to lack of data or changing conditions; validation of models; usability; rapid adjustment to changes in direction; facilitating collaboration; and communication of results to peers and stakeholders. Case studies of projects developed using this software modelling framework are used to illustrate and discuss the approach. The case studies span several fields of the social sciences, including Criminology, Geography, Political Science, and Public Health.

The first is to formulate novel ways to define and compute curve skeletons - a specific type of skeleton. The second is to employ skeletons to enhance surface reconstruction for geometry affected by severe amounts of missing data. In solving these challenges we discuss three different approaches. In the first approach we focus our attention to watertight geometry. We propose a curve skeletonization algorithm that evolves the shape's surface towards a curve by means of a motion that accentuates its local shape anisotropy. In the second approach we shift our attention to acquired data, where severe amounts of missing data introduce a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, we propose a technique that robustly extracts curve skeletons by interpreting its branches as local axes of rotational symmetry. We also propose an application that, by exploiting the extracted skeletons, helps to repair the data by performing a skeleton-based volumetric inpainting. Our last approach further explores the idea of volumetric inpainting by replacing curve skeletons with medial skeletons. Thanks to the fact that medial skeletons provide a natural volumetric representation of the shape, we propose a surface reconstruction method that considers volumetric smoothness as a novel and effective shape prior.Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Hao Zhang, Senior SupervisorDr. Ghassan Hamarneh, Co-supervisorDr. Kamal Gupta, Internal Examiner (ENSC)Dr. Paolo Cignoni, External Examiner (ISTI-­CNR)Dr. Richard Vaughan, Chair	Simon Fraser University

Meanwhile, increased capability of mobile devices is drastically increasing the mobile data usage. This increase is far in excess of mobile network capacities. Therefore, despite the higher availability of these networks, higher number of users they support, and their improved spectral efficiencies, effective utilization of wireless resources is required to keep up with the ever-increasing user demands for mobile content. This thesis targets high-throughput data transmission in advanced cellular wireless networks, and wireless mesh networks. These wireless networks have been widely used for broadband wireless access and are constantly enhanced for future applications. We present efficient resource allocation solutions to meet the transmission requirements of high bandwidth applications, like video streaming, in these networks. Our solutions combat bandwidth limitations in different settings, including dense networks and high mobility. We compare our proposed methods with state-of-the-art solutions and prove their effectiveness. We also discuss the availability of cost-effective wireless access solutions that are yet to be considered for expanding mobile data networks. If efficiently used, these networks can offload considerable traffic off the mobile networks. We discuss wireless local area networks for their abundant resources and extensive deployment. We present an optimal solution to opportunistically use dense deployment of local access points and collaboratively serve wireless users. We present our solution within a set of networks that share the same upstream provider. Our solutions show significantly improved throughput in dense implementations, a remarkable step towards pervasiveness in next generation of mobile communication systems.Keywords: Wireless Networks, 802.11, Mesh, WiFi, LTE, Cellular, Cell Array, and OptimizationPh.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Jiangchuan Liu, Senior SupervisorDr. Qianping Gu, SupervisorDr. Mohamed Hefeeda, Internal ExaminerDr. Lin Cai, External ExaminerDr. Petra Berenbrink, Chair	Simon Fraser University

As a consequence, alternative service delivery arrangements, in which non-government entities and private sector corporations are involved in public service delivery, have become increasingly popular in the last 30 years. The term “governance” is now commonly used to signify this shift away from a traditional hierarchical mode of government to a more horizontal environment of policy formulation and implementation. For many supporters of alternative service delivery, increased freedom for the private sector is regarded as the key to successful governance.Public-private partnerships (P3s) are a family of alternative service delivery mechanisms that allow the private sector to finance, own, and deliver goods and services to the public through long-term contractual arrangements with governments and other public sector agencies. P3s fit comfortably into the logic of alternative service delivery, which implies that by removing some – but not all – elements of the public sector and replacing them with some – but not all – aspects of the private sector, a balance between public sector accountability and private sector efficiency can be struck. However, this presents an inherent conflict, as the public sector is viewed simultaneously as the problem and as the solution to improving public service delivery. This inherent conflict in governance arrangements can sometimes lead to governance failure, a phenomenon that is not sufficiently understood. First, I show that governance failure can have negative consequences for the state and society. Then, I examine two case studies in P3 delivery of transportation infrastructure, the Canada Line in Vancouver, Canada and the Sydney Airport Link in Sydney, Australia, to determine how governance failure occurs and how it can be avoided. These two cases have similar technical parameters and political motivations, but in the Canadian case, where the public sector demonstrated policy leadership through the fostering of policy networks, through bounded-rational policy learning, and through a collaborative institutional approach to project implementation, successful governance was achieved. By contrast, the Australian case, in which the government was not substantially engaged in the partnership, resulted in governance failure. From an analysis of these two cases I conclude that public sector policy leadership is essential to the prevention of governance failure.	Simon Fraser University

Our investigation starts from peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing with social relations to contemporary cloud computing with flexible resource provisioning. We seek to leverage distributed resources for efficient sharing and collaboration, which leads to a hybrid system design that seamlessly bridges users' local resources to public datacenters. We first explore social-network-based optimizations in peer-to-peer content delivery. We give solid evidences that long-term social relations can be found and applied to enhance the sharing efficiency in peer-to-peer networks, and present practical implementation strategies for the popular BitTorrent system. We then investigate the performance of cloud-based file synchronization applications and identify the bottlenecks in their system design, in particular, the task interferences. We propose an interference-aware provisioning algorithm, which effectively mitigates the problem. We further examine the users' interactions in state-of-the-art cloud-based distributed interactive applications. We find that, despite the benefit in terms of cost savings and better scalability, the cloud-based deployment greatly increases the users' interaction latency. We demonstrate that a smart assignment algorithms for virtual machines can remarkably reduce such latency. Finally, we present a real-world system design that effectively bridges users' local resources to enterprise cloud platforms. Our measurements as well as system analysis indicate that it serves as a complement of great potentials to enterprise cloud services.

The need for new or redeveloped hospital infrastructure in particular has made this a leading avenue for P3 proliferation. The objective of this study is to analyze P3 policy and projects, principally in relation to the BC and Ontario provincial health sectors. The central arguments made are threefold: P3s are a unique form of accumulation by dispossession and public sector marketization; P3 projects are intrinsically unable to meet the promises made by proponents and carry several other negative social consequences beyond this; and P3 policy, though rooted in normative ideological assumptions and aspirations, is now increasingly normalized in BC and Ontario through the establishment of P3 enabling fields over the past decade. ‘Enabling fields’ capture the constellation of new arrangements that now serves to normalize P3 use: new capital planning procedures and legislative frameworks, supportive secondary reforms, and greater institutional support for privatization. Together these elements help routinize, institutionalize, and depoliticize P3 policy. Canada’s pioneering full spectrum P3 hospitals (where the private partner is charged with designing, building, operating, and financing the facility) are examined in detail: in BC, the Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Centre and the Gordon and Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre; and in Ontario, the Brampton Civic Hospital and the Royal Ottawa Hospital. These cases reveal the troubling results that policy normalization ignores: poor value for money and inadequate risk transfer, misleading claims of ‘on time and on budget’ delivery, an erosion of service quality and working conditions, and opaque partnership agreements that offer little by way of accountability and transparency.

The $M$-partition problem asks whether the vertices of a given graph $G$ can be partitioned into $m$ parts $V_0,V_1\cdots,V_{m-1}$ such that any two distinct vertices in (possibly equal) parts $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent if $M(i,j)=1$, and non-adjacent if $M(i,j)=0$, while $M(i,j)=*$ signifies no restriction. This problem generalizes the $k$-coloring, the $H$-coloring and many other well-known graph problems. In its list version, which is called the list $M$-partition problem, a list is assigned to each vertex to restrict its placement into certain parts. A current direction is to study the complexity of (list) $M$-partition problems (for different matrices $M$). The main open problem, known as the dichotomy problem, asks whether each $M$-partition problem is polynomial or NP-complete.The difficulty of this problem led to studying restrictions on the input graphs. A secondary goal was to identify the well-known graph classes for which all (list) $M$-partition problems are polynomial. Several graph classes including perfect graphs, chordal graphs, etc have been studied so far. In this thesis we continues this line of research, focusing mainly on the list version. We identify certain graph classes defined in terms of geometric configurations, and we prove that for these classes all list $M$-partition problems are polynomial. These classes include such well-known classes as interval and circular arc graphs. We also consider other standard graphs classes including some generalizations of the above classes, line graphs and their extensions to quasi-line and claw-free graphs, and some special cases of $H$-free graphs. For these classes we prove a positive answer to the dichotomy problem for certain kinds of matrices $M$. \textbf{Keywords:} list $M$-partition problem, graph partitions, homomorphism, special graph classes, perfect graphs, interval graphs, line graphs, $H$-free graphs, dichotomy \ewline\textbf{Subject Terms:} Graph Theory, Graph Coloring, Graph Partitions, Graph AlgorithmsPh.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Pavol Hell, Senior SupervisorDr. Gabor Tardos, SupervisorDr. Andrei Bulatov, SupervisorDr. Binay Bhattacharya, Internal ExaminerDr. Kathie Cameron, External ExaminerDr. Ramesh Krishnamurti, Chair	Simon Fraser University

Chapter one examines underutilizing capital to preserve the environment. I consider an economy in which building new capital units may create additions to pollution of the same kind that production of a general factor creates. The second chapter analyzes the distribution of investment in dirty versus clean technologies when building new capital units creates such emissions. The third aspect, in Chapter three, is the planning and dispatch of dirty and clean production capacity given the fluctuation of clean technology inputs, in particular of renewable energy for electricity production. Chapter 1: If the utilization of dirty technology capital can be chosen then emissions can be saved. If underutilization postpones capital use, replacing investment, then emissions from investment can be prevented. This is of particular interest in regard to climate change, because currently existing fossil-fuel using machines have been built without regard to the climate, and investment in clean energy technology creates emissions. I examine the Pareto optimal utilization of dirty and clean technology capital and their irreversible investment in controlling an environmental stock. Dirty technology production is below capacity if government policy internalizes the externality after such policy is sufficiently long delayed. Capital can be optimally underutilized if the pollution is below its long-term level. Optimal early utilization diminishes the capital stock until investment becomes worthwhile followed by full utilization. The emissions tax that implements an optimum is smaller in those early periods than the tax that induces a welfare maximum under the premise that producers fully utilize capital. Clean technology capital may be underutilized to save emissions from investment or because creating new units is more costly than forwarding existing units. Chapter 2: The paper studies the role of emissions from investment for the distribution of investment among dirty and clean technologies. Dirty technology may not be used at a stationary point that is a Quasi-Clean Age because the cost of pollution reduction relative to consumption increase is smaller for the dirty technology, though clean technology may be relatively more expensive on all scales, and the societal effect of the first pollution unit may be small. In plausible cases there is a unique stationary point. If technologies imply a continuum of stationary points then the point with greatest clean capacity is optimal. If the discount factor is not too small then disregarding emissions from investment in dirty technology biases the stationary cost of polluting downward, because society is willing to pay more to preserve the environment if it has less polluting technology and accounting a greater portion of emissions in investment lowers the complete emission intensity. The paper establishes relationships between the investment in clean technology, the cost of polluting, and the shadow return or marginal rate of return. Chapter 3: This paper examines production using a dirty and reliable technology versus production using a clean and unreliable technology in a dynamic economy. Consumption can be efficiently equal across states because investment absorbs the fluctuation in clean technology productivity in days in which consumption is maximized. In the celebrated case dirty technology backs up production in states when productivity of clean technology is low, yet the underutilization of dirty technology capital when the clean technology’s productivity is high does not smooth consumption across all states in a long period in which capital is built. Clean output subsidies such as feed-in premiums, when rebating a general energy tax or a general tax on investment goods that produce energy, or that differentiate the surcharge in a fully-funded system between households, can implement a Pareto optimum.

Concerns have been raised regarding how challenging it is for the various youth justice professionals such as judges, lawyers and youth probation officers responsible for implementing this law to apply it consistently across cases with varying characteristics.  This study will examine the complexity of the YCJA from a theoretical, legal and policy perspective by looking at a number of different aspects of the legislation.  Firstly, a description of five theoretical models of youth justice will be explored in order to help explain the varying case law interpretations of certain YCJA provisions by provincial/territorial and appellate judges, including key decisions made by the Supreme Court of Canada to resolve the case law debate across Canada.  Secondly, this study examines the perceptions and decision-making styles of 147 youth probation officer’s from the province of British Columbia.  It involves probation officers reviewing five actual serious and/or violent young offender cases from across Canada.  Their theoretical orientation to each case was derived as well as a comparative analysis of YPO sentencing recommendations and the final judicial sentencing decision.  Finally, this study will report on a qualitative sample of Canadian youth justice policy analysts in relation to the potential impact of the deterrence principle being added to the YCJA in October 2012.Location: Faculty Conference Room (Room 10121, Saywell Hall)	Simon Fraser University

HTS has become an invaluable technology for many applications, e.g. the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variations, isoform prediction and quantification. In most of these applications, mapping sequenced "reads" to their potential genomic origin is the firstfundamental step for subsequent analyses. Many tools have been developed to address this problem. Because of the large amount of HTS data availability, much emphasis has been placed on speed and memory. In fact, as HTS data grow in size, data management and storage are becoming major logistical obstacles for adopting HTS platforms. The requirements for ever increasing monetary investment almost signalled the end of the Sequence Read Archive hosted at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which holds most of the sequence data generated world wide. One way to solve storage requirements for HTS data is compression. Currently, most HTS data is compressed through general purpose algorithms such as gzip. These algorithms are not specifically designed for compressing data generated by the HTS platforms; for example, they do not take advantage of the specific nature of genomic sequence data, that is, limited alphabet size and high similarity among reads. Recently, a number of fast and efficient compression algorithms have been designed specifically for HTS data  to address some of the issues in data management, storage and communication.  In this thesis, we study both of these computational problems, i.e., Sequence Mapping and Sequence Compression extensively. We introduce two novel methods namely mrsFAST and drFAST to map HTS short reads to the reference genome. These methods are cache oblivious and guarantee perfect sensitivity. Both are specifically designed to address the bottleneck of multi-mapping for the purpose of structural variation detection. In addition we present Dissect for mapping whole trascriptome to the genome while considering structural alterations in the transcriptome. Dissect is designed specifically to map long HTS reads as well as assembled contigs. Finally, we address the storage and communication problems in HTS data by introducing SCALCE,  a ``boosting'' scheme based on Locally Consistent Parsing technique. SCALCE re-orders the HTS data in order to increase the locality of reference and subsequently improve the performance of well known compression methods in terms of speed and space.Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Cenk Sahinalp, Senior SupervisorDr. Colin Collins, SupervisorDr. Peter Unrau, Internal ExaminerDr. Bonnie Berger, External ExaminerGreg Baker, Chair	Simon Fraser University

We propose several approaches to leveraging other available sources in SMT systems to enhance the quality of translation. Particularly, we propose approaches suitable in these four scenarios:1. when an additional parallel corpus is available;2. when parallel corpora between the source language and a third language and between that language and the target language are available;3. when an abundant source-language monolingual corpus is available;4. when no additional resource is available.In the heart of these solutions lie two novel approaches: ensemble decoding and a graph propagation approach for paraphrasing out-of-vocabulary words.Ensemble decoding combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in machine translation.We extend ensemble decoding to do triangulation on-the-fly when there exist parallel corpora between the source language and one or multiple pivot languages and between those and the target language. These triangulated systems are dynamically combined together and possibly to a direct source-target system. Experiments in 12 different language pairs show significant improvements over the baselines in terms of BLEU scores.Ensemble decoding can also be used to apply stacking to statistical machine translation. Stacking is an ensemble learning approach that enhances the bias of the models. We show that stacking can consistently and significantly improve over the conventional SMT systems in two different language pairs and three different training sizes. In addition to ensemble decoding, we propose a novel approach to mining translations for OOV words using a monolingual corpus on the source-side language. We induce a lexicon by constructing a graph on the source language phrases and employ a graph propagation technique in order to find translations for those phrases. Experimental results in two different settings show that our graph propagation method significantly improves performance over two strong baselines under intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation metrics.

The rational design of these devices requires the understanding of the NW growth mechanism in order to control the NW size and morphology, the NW doping, and the ability to grow coherent heterostructures. In this thesis, we grew gold-catalyzed III-V NWs via the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism using the metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) technique. We explored the details of VLS growth mechanisms by analyzing the dependence of NW growth rate on NW diameter. We presented a systematic study of the effect of precursor chemistry (i.e. group III precursor and CBr4 dopant) on the growth of GaAs NWs. We showed that precursor chemistry can be employed as a useful mean to grow axial or radial heterostructures. A model to estimate the critical dimensions of core/shell NWs based on elasticity theory was presented. The numerical calculations were carried out for various III-V core/shell NWs and showed excellent agreement with experimental results obtained for core/shell NWs grown using various III-V materials. We demonstrated both core and shell doping of GaAs NWs using Te- (n-type) and C- (p-type) dopants. Electrical measurements were performed using a nanoprobe within a scanning electron microscope on individual NWs and doping levels and conduction mechanisms were determined. The incorporation pathways of dopants into the NWs were discussed based on the analysis of the observed dependence of measure resistivity on NW diameter.EXAMINING COMMITTEEDr. J.

There is an overall critical absence in these theories about the role of broader structural causes of terrorism such as economic conditions.  The limited number of theories/models examining the link between economic conditions and terrorism are relatively underdeveloped.  Many economic theories or models concentrate largely on identifying broad macro-level theoretical constructs to indicate when individuals or groups within society are willing to participate in terrorist movements.  A significant number of these perspectives emphasize the central role of relative deprivation and highlight various economic indicators to measure this construct, but fail to provide an associated explanation about the process by which individuals become deprived and the exact factors that lead to this economic deprivation.The present thesis adapts the economic hypotheses of Corrado’s anti-state terrorism model in order to explain the rise and the decline of Sikh anti-state terrorism in Punjab.  The thesis incorporates quantitative empirical data to show economic conditions in Punjab and examines trends in Sikh violence.  This thesis also modifies Corrado’s economic anti-state terrorism model in order to improve its comprehensiveness and direct applicability to the Punjab conflict.  The revised model has been directly shaped by economic conditions specific to Punjab that contributed to the economic deprivation of the Sikh population.  The new model is unique in that it provides a detailed account and theoretical link as to how specific economic conditions in Punjab contributed directly to feelings of relative deprivation amongst the Sikh population, which led to the rise of Sikh terrorism.  This thesis explains how the amelioration of these economic conditions led to the decline of the violent Sikh anti-state terrorism movement.  This new economic anti-state terrorism model provides a new and vibrant perspective on how nations can prevent the rise of anti-state terrorism movements, or reduce active terrorist violence within their borders.

Much of that energy is wasted because applications compete for shared resources and suffer severe performance penalties due to resource contention. Contention for shared resources remains an unsolved problem in existing datacenters despite significant research efforts dedicated to this problem in the past. The goal of this work is to investigate how and to what extent contention for shared resource can be mitigated via workload scheduling. Scheduling is an attractive tool, because it does not require extra hardware and is relatively easy to integrate into the system. I have designed and implemented multiple Open Source and proprietary schedulers during my work on this dissertation. Most notably, I introduced the Distributed Intensity Online (DIO) scheduler to target the shared resource contention in the memory hierarchy of Uniform Memory Access (UMA) systems, followed by the Distributed Intensity NUMA Online (DINO) scheduler that I designed to improve performance and decrease power consumption on Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) servers. As part of my internship in HP Labs, I designed a work conserving scheduler that prioritizes access to the multiple CPU cores on an industry level multicore server, thus managing contention for CPU and improving server power efficiency. Finally, the Clavis2D framework extends the contention awareness to the datacenter level and provides a comprehensive cluster scheduling solution that simultaneously takes into account multiple performance- and power-related goals. My dissertation work utilizes state-of-the-art industry level datacenter infrastructure, does not require any modification or prior knowledge about the workload and provides significant performance and energy benefits on-the-fly. Key words: multicore processors, scheduling, shared resource contention, performance evaluation.

Many believe that liberal democratic states are less likely to engage in conflict and are more likely to respect human rights. Security sector reform (SSR) is critical in peacebuilding, as poor security creates obstacles for establishing peace and fostering political, economic and social development. Criminal justice reform, a component of SSR, is designed to establish respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in post-conflict environments (PCEs). This dissertation explores post-conflict criminal justice reform activities through a case study of corrections reform in Kosovo. Fourteen retired, current, and former CSC employees who participated in corrections reform activities in Kosovo from 1999 to 2006 participated in in-person or telephone interviews for this study. Participants described the dynamics and challenges they experienced while conducting corrections reform activities abroad. Participants’ perceptions about the appropriateness of using UN and Western-developed frameworks in Kosovo and other PCEs were also captured. Building on previous international literature exploring PCEs and peacebuilding activities, this project contributes to the post-conflict corrections reform literature.Many of the findings reflect extant literature documenting the dynamics involved in conducting criminal justice reform in PCEs. These include the importance of tailoring corrections reform activities to the local context, and the need to address corruption and promote gender mainstreaming. Most of the challenges – e.g. a lack of resources, and difficulties in providing safe and secure confinement – are consistent with practitioner-based literature about corrections reform activities in PCEs. The findings also reveal interpersonal dynamics and challenges: most and least rewarding experiences, personal insecurities that arise as a consequence of the work, and “job shrink” that occurs upon returning from mission. Overall, participants support liberal peacebuilding activities as long as the local context, objectives, and timing of the activities are carefully considered at each stage of the process.Keywords: post-conflict environments; corrections reform; criminal justice reform; security sector reform; peacebuilding; peace operations Location: Faculty Conference Room - Saywell Hall Room 10121	Simon Fraser University

As people move about, their familiarity with the spatial areas around, and in between, the nodes increases, eventually forming their Activity Space. Offenders have similar spatial movement patterns and Activity Spaces as non-offenders, hence, according to theory, an offender will commit the crimes in their own Activity Space. The goal of this Dissertation is to introduce a novel approach, called Directionality-based Activity Space Creator (DASC), to reconstruct the Activity Space of offenders. Before this reconstruction however, first the crime locations for each individual were analyzed to establish directionality preference on the individual level, after which the directionality preferences were analyzed at the city level to establish aggregate patterns. Once the existence of directionality preference had been established, these preferences were analyzed across various crime types and cities to show robustness. These preferences were then used to detect the individual Paths in the Activity Spaces. Information about all Paths were then used to detect the Nodes in the region, which were then assigned to individuals, completing their Activity Space. To test the accuracy of this model, the Activity Spaces of 322 repeat offenders within the City of Surrey, Canada, were reconstructed and used to recommend likely suspects for new crimes. Recommendation was based on the crime’s proximity to the Activity Spaces of the offenders. The higher the actual offender was within the recommended set, the more accurate the model. Results indicate that by reconstructing the Activity Spaces, recommendations could be made which were five to seven times as accurate as the naïve selection.Location: Thesis Defence Room (Room 2020, WAC Bennett Library)	Simon Fraser University

Ethnographic studies on drug trafficking have proposed that different forms of capital have an impact on the patterns of drug trafficking careers. The effects of conventional and criminal capital, however, have been the object of much less empirical attention. Drawing from information on the criminal careers of 182 incarcerated drug traffickers, this study examines the role of conventional and criminal social capital on three dimensions of the criminal career perspective: the timing of entry into the illicit drug trade, the entry positions as a type of criminal achievement that traffickers first obtain in the drug distribution chain, and the progression of trafficking careers. Results suggest that weak conventional capital (e.g. legitimate employment) enhances the early onset into trafficking careers. An offer coming from a friend or family member to enter the trade and self initiation trigger the early onset. High levels of both criminal human (skills) and criminal social (contacts) capital are linked to starting at the most prestigious positions in the trade. In addition, criminal social capital is the most important factor to predict the progression of the trafficking careers, while legitimate employment negatively affects the progression. Limitations and policy implications are discussed as well. Key words: criminal careers, drug trafficking, conventional capital, criminal capital	Simon Fraser University

A central assumption of this dissertation is that the social structure of a pre-planned fraud has consequences for understanding how and why such a fraud spread to such a large number of victims, and the implications for the nature of the investment that victims made, or the harm they suffered after it was revealed that they were involved in a fraud. Using data from a detailed survey of 559 victims of Eron Mortgage, a fraud which deceived 2,285 investors for $240 million between 1993 and 1997, this dissertation draws from social network analysis, diffusion theory and models of trust, adding to the body of literature on white-collar crime in the context of fraud victimization. Results show that characteristics of social ties within the structure of the Eron network were responsible for the successful spread of the fraud: 1) Eron principals and Eron employees invested their personal time and effort recruiting investors; 2) independent brokers actively spread the fraud to their clients; and 3) investors themselves, unknowingly spread the fraud through their social networks by recruiting their friends and family to invest in Eron. Findings also show that trust in specific types of social ties is associated with increased initial investments and different types of harms experienced by victims (emotional, financial, and harm to friends and family relations). Respondents who reported having been influenced to invest by multiple types of sources however generally reported lower levels of loss of capital and harms suffered. The social chain element inherent in the structure of Ponzi schemes plays a dual role in either protecting against or being the cause of malfeasance, having implications for fraud victimization and making it an important factor to integrate in future studies on white-collar crime.

Community Power and Urban Regime Theory RevisitedAbstract: The central research question herein is “how do coalitions of government and non-government actors get created and influence the decision-making processes of municipal government in Vancouver, British Columbia?” The goal of this effort is to better understand “who really governs?” (Dahl, 1961) at the municipal level of government in the city during two ‘adjacent’ eras – the development of the post-Expo ’86 lands in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, and the creation and implementation of the Vancouver Agreement (VA), including the development of Vancouver as North America’s first supervised/safe injection site/harm reduction model, in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. This dissertation considers not only the structures, actors and ideas of municipal governments but also the creation, influence and power of the various coalitions, the urban regimes, as defined by Stone (1989), that form around local decision-making. It is clear from this examination that coalitions of government and non-government actors, urban regimes, were created and influenced the decision-making processes involved in the development of former Expo ’86 lands and the creation and implementation of the Vancouver Agreement. In addition, there were continuities and discontinuities identified, linked to the type of policy being considered by the Vancouver municipal government. In sum, this analysis found that the nature of the decision-making processes, and by extension the urban regimes that were created, were issue-dependent. Urban regimes involved in what Bish and Clemens (2008) have described as “hard” (or “engineering”) issues, such as land development, were substantially different in nature to those involved in “soft” (or human policy”) issues, such as the provision of addiction services - the substance of policy issues mattered more than institutions.

Hiero models are more powerful than phrase-based models in capturing complex source-target reordering as well as discontiguous phrase pairs while being easier to estimate and decode with compared to their full syntaxbased counterparts. In this thesis, we propose improvements to two broad aspects of the Hiero translation pipeline: i) estimating Hiero translation model features from training data and ii) parameter tuning for discriminative log-linear models that are used to decode with such features. We use our own open-source implementation of Hiero called Kriya (Sankaran et al., 2012b) for all the experiments in this thesis. This thesis contains the following specific contributions: • We propose new Bayesian models which are used to extract compact Hiero translation rules; we extract minimal source-target translation units, resulting in up to 57% reduction in model size while retaining the same translation performance for several language pairs (Sankaran et al., 2011; Sankaran et al., 2012a). Our models are applicable for both unary and binary Hiero grammars and our models consistently perform well compared to several other baselines. We also show that our model can be estimated in a distributed framework for variational inference (Sankaran et al., 2013a). • We propose a novel unified-cascade framework for jointly learning alignments and the Hiero translation rules by removing the disconnect between the alignments and extracted synchronous context-free grammar. This is the first time a joint training framework is being proposed for Hiero, where we iterate the two step inference so that it learns in alternate iterations the phrase alignments and then the Hiero rules that are consistent with alignments. • We propose several novel approaches for parameter tuning of discriminative log-linear models for SMT which can be used for jointly optimizing towards multiple evaluation metrics. We show that our methods for multi-objective tuning for SMT yield substantial gains in translation quality measured through automatic as well as human evaluations (Sankaran et al., 2013b; Duh et al., 2013).

First, we propose a semi-supervised, kinetic-modeling-based segmentation technique to identify functional regions of interest. It is an iterative, self-learning algorithm based on uncertainty principles and is designed to be robust to the problems of low signal-to-noise ratio and partial volume effect. Second, we develop an interactive analysis and visualization tool for probabilistic segmentations of medical images. We provide a systematic approach to analyze, interact, and highlight regions of segmentation uncertainty. Finally, we introduce a set of multidimensional transfer function widgets to analyze multivariate probabilistic field data. These widgets furnish the user with contextual information about conformance or deviation from the population statistics. We demonstrate the ability to identify suspicious regions (e.g. tumors) and to correct misclassification results.

Because of their large magnetic anisotropy barriers and associated stable magnetic moments, single molecule magnets (SMMs) bring a new dimension to this field and also raise the possibility of molecular magnetic information storage and quantum computation. Therefore the transport properties of transistors based on individual SMMs are attracting considerable experimental and theoretical interest at present.This thesis presents a theoretical investigation of the electron and spin transport and associated phenomena in SMM transistors (SMMTs).  A tight binding model is developed as an alternative approach to the giant spin Hamiltonian and density functional theory (DFT) methodologies for studying SMMs.  Unique aspects of this approach are that it captures more physics than the giant spin Hamiltonians do but is much simpler than DFT and it has more flexibility for modeling experimental behaviors. Because of its simplicity this model is helpful in developing a physical understanding of SMMs and their transport properties. The tight binding model yields the total Mn12 SMM spin, the spins of the individual Mn ions, the magnetic easy axis orientation, the size of the magnetic anisotropy barrier and the size of the HOMO-LUMO gap consistent with experiments. Based on this tight binding methodology, this thesis addresses the following transport problems of current interest: ligand-based transport resonances in SMMTs, gate controlled switching between Coulomb blockade and coherent resonant tunneling in SMMTs, identification of the orientation of the magnetic easy axis of a SMM, the spin filtering effect of the SMMTs, quantum dot spin valves based on SMMs which support ligand--based transport, and tunneling and cotunneling transport through Mn12 SMMs in the weak coupling regime.

The vast majority of research on school problem risk factors and offending focus on delinquency as opposed to serious and violent offending by youth.  Research has demonstrated that school problems (poor academic performance, truancy, dropout) are related to delinquency.  The aim of the current study is to assess whether school and family problems are significant predictors of serious violent and serious property offences for incarcerated youth.  This study also examines whether Aboriginal ethnicity is a significant predictor of serious violent and serious property offences.  Data for this thesis is from a sample of serious and violent young offenders in custody drawn from two secure custody facilities and two open custody units located in a major urban centre of British Columbia, Canada (n = 404).  The sample consists of youth (aged 12-19) who were interviewed as part of the research project entitled the Vancouver Serious and Violent Incarcerated Young Offenders Study.  Bivariate tests and logistic regression models are used to analyze the role of school and family problems in predicting serious violent and serious property offences.  Results show that school problems, family problems, age, mental health problems, and substance use are significant predictors of serious violent offences.  Family problems, mental health problems, gender, and Aboriginal ethnicity are significant predictors of serious property offences.  School problems, gender, age, mental health problems, and substance use are significant predictors of serious violent and serious property offences (SVSP offences).  School problems, family problems, gender, mental health problems, and substance use are significant predictors of no serious violent and no serious property offences (no-SVSP offences).  When adjusting for the effect of demographics, mental health problems, and substance use, school and family problems are important independent predictors of serious violent offences and no-SVSP offences.  School problems are also a strong independent predictor of SVSP offences.  Family problems emerged as an independent risk factor for serious property offences.

The dissertation is driven by three interrelated aims. First, the study aims to assess whether variations in opportunities for membership and the nature of gang entry are related to pre-memberships factors. Second, it aims to investigate whether gangs’ organizational structures and group processes are associated with the nature of their criminal opportunities. Third, it explores the relationship of both individual and group factors to the disengagement process. The study uses self-reported and official data gathered from a sample of 73 gang members involved in the Study on Incarcerated Serious and Violent Young Offender in Burnaby, British Columbia. Results suggest that being embedded in a criminal social environment facilitates early entry into gangs but not avoidance of an initiation in gangs that require them. A need for recognition and respect is associated with late entry and the occurrence of an initiation. A closer look into the initiation events described by participants revealed three general types: (1) the ego violent event, (2) the crime commission, and (3) the expressive violence towards others. An ego violent initiation was more frequent among younger prospective members and those who were coerced into joining. Individuals who were looking for respect were more likely to be required to perpetrate an act of violence toward someone in order to get in. No individual characteristics were associated with crime commission type. In terms of group characteristics, nature of initiation is not associated with any type of gang organizational structure: both organized and less organized gangs may initiate their members and do so in similar ways. Type of initiation, however, was found to reflect the nature of the criminal activities of the gangs. In terms of gang desistance, internal gang violence and pre-membership criminal social environment both facilitated the persistence of membership and delay in disengagement from gangs. The dissertation addresses the theoretical and policy implications of such findings.Keywords: gangs; initiation, social capital, violence, group processes, desistanceLocation: Faculty Conference Room (Room 10121, Saywell Hall)	Simon Fraser University

Development of efficient algorithms for problems on unit disk graphs has therefore been a hot topic largely driven by the practical applications. This is while there are no general frameworks known in the literature for obtaining parameterized algorithms or kernelization results on UDGs. Clique Partition is one of the Richard Karp's original 21 NP-hard problems and is proved to be an extremely useful tool for obtaining solutions for other fundamental combinatorial problems such as Dominating Set, UDG Realization and Facility Location. We make the following contributions in this thesis: (1) We develop a novel framework for obtaining parameterized and FPT algorithms for Clique Partition and related problems on UDGs. (2) We bridge the complexity gap between the UDG and precision UDG classes through introducing a new useful subclass, namely quasi-precision UDGs, with interesting properties. We further describe (relaxed)-quasi-precision UDGs by proving structural properties for the subclass and classify the cases when the problems do not admit FPT algorithms under our framework (3) We propose a new approach for constructing polynomial approximation schemes (PTAS) for Minimum Clique Partition on UDGs which results in significant computational speed-up comparing to the best previously known PTAS for the problem. (4) We introduce first-time data reduction rules for the problems of Clique Partition and Weighted Clique Partition and enhanced data reduction rules for Clique Cover on UDGs. (5) We develop a framework for obtaining linear-size kernels on quasi-precision UDGs and provide the sufficient criteria for the problems under which the framework applies.Keywords: Parameterized algorithms, Unit Disk Graphs, Kernelization, Data reduction.Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Qian-ping Gu, Senior SupervisorDr. Pavol Hell, SupervisorDr. Jiangchuan Liu, Internal ExaminerDr. Guochuan Zhang, External ExaminerDr. Ramesh Krishnamurti, Chair	Simon Fraser University

There are two competing mechanisms via which this can happen: the pp chain and CNO cycle. The latter is a cycle of reactions involving carbon, nitrogen and oxygen which are catalysts for the conversion of hydrogen into helium. The slowest reaction 14N(p,gamma)15O in the cycle will affect the energy generation timescale and the amount of helium ash produced via the CNO cycle. This has several astrophysical impacts. It affects the evolutionary timescale of main sequence stars from which the ages of globular clusters can be calculated, the nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in H burning shells of red giant stars, and the fraction of energy produced by the CNO cycle compared to the pp chain in our Sun which helps determine the interior composition of the Sun.For main sequence stars the CNO cycle dominates over the pp chain for core temperatures T < 0.02 GK. For the 14N(p,gamma)15O reaction this corresponds to a low center of mass energy E_cm = 30 keV. This is lower than the low energy limit of the reaction rate measurable in the laboratory, i.e. background would swamp the signal. This means that we need to extrapolate down to low energy using theory. The largest remaining uncertainty in the theoretical calculations is due to the width Gamma of the 6.79 MeV state in 15O. This can be obtained through the lifetime tau via the equation Gamma=hbar/tau.In this work the lifetimes of three excited states of 15O were measured using the Doppler shift attenuation method (DSAM) populating the states via the 3He(16O,alpha)15O reaction at a beam energy of 50 MeV. The low lifetime limit measurable using the DSAM is ~1 fs. The lifetime of the 6.79 MeV state is near that limit, making this measurement challenging. A 1.84 fs upper limit (68.3% C.L.) on this lifetime is reported here. In addition we measured the lifetimes of the 6.17 and 6.86 MeV state in 15O which were < 2.5 fs and 13.3^(+0.8)_(−1.2) fs (68.3% C.L.) respectively.Examining CommitteeChair: Dr. Malcom KennettSenior Supervisor: Dr. Dugan O’NeilSupervisor: Dr. Barry DavidsSupervisor: Dr. Paul HaljanSFU Examiner: Dr. Howard TrottierExternal Examiner: Dr. Roby Austin, Saint Mary’s University	Simon Fraser University

Also,since these languages depend on background solvers, the recent advancements inthe efficiency of solvers has positively affected the usability of such languages. This thesis studies extensions of knowledge representation (KR) languages with arithmetical operators and methods to combine different KR languages.With respect to arithmetic in declarative KR languages, we show that existing KRlanguages suffer from a huge disparity between their expressiveness and theircomputational power. Therefore, we develop an ideal KR language that capturesthe complexity class NP for arithmetical search problems and guaranteesuniversality and efficiency for solving such problems.Moreover, we introduce a framework to language-independently combine modulesfrom different KR languages. We study complexity and expressiveness of ourframework and develop algorithms to solve modular systems. We define twosemantics for modular systems based on (1) a model-theoretical view and (2) anoperational view on modular systems. We prove that our two semantics coincideand also develop mechanisms to approximate answers to modular systems using theoperational view. We augment our algorithm these approximation mechanisms tospeed up the process of solving modular system.We further generalize our modular framework and introduce supported modelsemantics that disallows models of a modular system to be self-justifying. Weshow that supported model semantics generalizes our two previousmodel-theoretical and operational semantics. We compare and contrast theexpressiveness of our framework under supported model semantics with anotherframework for interlinking knowledge bases, i.e., multi-context systems, andprove that supported model semantics generalizes and unifies different semanticsof multi-context systems. Motivated by the wide expressiveness of supportedmodels, we also define a new supported equilibrium semantics for multi-contextsystems and show that supported equilibrium semantics generalizes previoussemantics for multi-context systems. Furthermore, we also define supportedsemantics for propositional programs and show that supported model semnaticsgeneralizes the acclaimed stable model semantics and extends the two celebratedproperties of rationality and minimality of intended models beyond the scope oflogic programs.Keywords:Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Declarative Problem Solving, Built-inArithmetic, Modularity, Language-independence, Supported Semantics, Stable Model Semantics, Multi-context SystemsPh.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Evgenia Ternovska, Senior SupervisorDr. Uwe Glasser, SupervisorDr. David Mitchell, SupervisorDr. Oliver Schulte, Internal ExaminerDr. Miroslaw Truszczynski, External ExaminerDr. Andrei Bulatov, Chair	Simon Fraser University

Faced with limited proof of ‘what works’ for clusters, frustration is spreading among policy makers and stakeholders. The study offers a comparative analysis of high-technology clusters around the globe with the objective of finding a generalizable mechanism for making cluster policy successful. Interviews conducted with officials, researchers and industry stakeholders in Chicago, Copenhagen, Singapore and Vancouver reveal that networks have found a novel way of cluster support by having a ‘facilitator’.This network management institution or individual is able to connect and support cluster stakeholders while simultaneously linking them to government with the goal of better tailored policy and ultimately more successful innovative processes. The dissertation offers a new theoretical framework for investigating the facilitation mechanism based on intersecting science and technology policy, network management and innovation systems literature. The study highlights the fact that the key to success is the creation of capacity for networking (collaborative capacity) and identifying useful knowledge, knowledge gaps and future developments (absorptive capacity) rather than focusing solely on output. The central findings are threefold: Not only does facilitation exist in different parts of the world, it also enhances performance and varies depending on location. The variations include a government- and stakeholder-funded model in most European countries, an independent model in North America and finally, a government-financed model in Asia.

More specifically, the link between maternal juvenile delinquency, adult offending, and the development of children’s physical aggression in the early childhood period is investigated. This dissertation adopts a life-course framework to explore two particularly important life experiences that are particularly relevant for many women: pregnancy and motherhood. Considering the negative adult outcomes that many female juvenile delinquents experience (e.g., social adversity, substance abuse, mental health problems), risky maternal behaviours during pregnancy, and difficulties with parenting are examined as potential mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviour. This dissertation consists of three distinct, yet related empirical studies based on a sample of mothers and their preschool children. The sample is drawn from the Vancouver Longitudinal Study on the Psychosocial Development of Children. Study I of this dissertation explored how mothers with a history of juvenile delinquency experience pregnancy. It was found that they are more likely to use substances while pregnant, and their children are more likely to be physically aggressive. Study II examined specific patterns of maternal parenting practices. It was found that these practices are linked with maternal adult offending, mental health problems (e.g., depressive and anxious symptoms), cultural background (non-Caucasian ethnicity), and children’s aggression. Study III focused on the persistence of children’s physical aggression during the preschool years, and found that maternal criminogenic, mental health and parenting factors are related to the development of children’s aggression. Importantly, cultural differences were found when comparing the predictors of children’s aggression for mothers born in North America and those born elsewhere. Taken together, the three studies suggest that there is significant intergenerational transmission of aggression and antisocial behaviour from mother to child, and it emerges from the earliest developmental periods. Moreover, important cultural differences were identified, which have several implications for policy and treatment.	Simon Fraser University

Most of these problems are NP-complete, so no known polynomial-time algorithms exist. Usually, the available solution for a user facing such problems involves mathematical programming for example, integer-linear programming tools, constraint logic programming tools and development of custom-designed implementations of algorithms for solving NP-hard problems. Successful use of these approaches normally requires a deep knowledge of programming, and is often time consuming. Another approach to attack NP search problems is to utilize the knowledge of users to produce precise descriptions of their (search) problem in a declarative specification or modelling language. A solver then takes a specification, together with an instance of the problem, and produces a solution to the problem, if there is any. Model expansion (MX), the logical task of expanding a given (mathematical) structure by new relations, is one of the well-studied directions of this approach. Formally, in MX, the user axiomatizes their problem in a language. This axiomatization describes the relationship between an instance (a given finite structure, i.e., a universe together with some relations and functions), and its solutions (certain expansions of that structure). This thesis presents the Enfragmo system for specifying and solving combinatorial search problems. Enfragmo takes a problem specification, in which the axioms are expressed in an extension of first order logic, and a problem instance as its input and produces a propositional conjunctive normal form formula that is sent to a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver. In this thesis, we describe several techniques that we have developed in order to build our well performing solver, Enfragmo.

Experimentally, it is found that proteins that have attractive interactions are able to localize to one or both of the poles in cylindrical bacteria. We put forward a model that only relies on the aggregating tendency of proteins and the occlusion by the bacterial nucleoid. Monte-Carlo simulations enabled us to find the stable and metastable localization patterns patterns, allowing us to explore the phase space of parameters in our model. Our findings provide an explanation for the different patterns observed for PopZ localization in Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus as well as misfolded proteins. We find the kinetics of expressing proteins has a crucial role: unipolar patterning is an energetically favorable state while other polar patterns can be achieved at higher rates of protein expression. Using sets of different GFP tagged aggregating proteins we are able to experimentally test this prediction and alter the localization from unipolar to bipolar simply by increasing the rate of expression. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the structuring of the DNA within the eukaryotic nucleous and its associated proteins. A new high-throughput experimental technique, Hi-C, is able to measure the looping frequencies between all parts of the genome. We transform the measured data and are able to extract a distance independent free energyby subtracting out the background free energy of interactions due to the polymer nature of DNA. Our mean-field model quantifies the interaction strengths between chromatin factors and loops along the chromosomes in a protein pairwise interaction matrix Jμ, υ. Since the Hi-C data carries different biases, using our approach we are able to assess the best sets of corrections that lead to the free energy having the most mutual information with the underlying chromatin profiles. Further to this, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the frequent modes of genome wide looping. Hence we are able to correlate these with known domain structures such as boundaries between active and silent regions of the genome.	Simon Fraser University

Its objectives were to determine the treatment at law and in practice of individuals in these circumstances, to identify any forensic and legal factors that contribute to differences in outcome in the criminal justice system, and to assess the extent to which these outcomes accord with underlying theoretical constructs and Charter values.  Legal and qualitative research methodologies were employed, the latter of which took the form of interviews with criminal justice actors involved in the management of cases in British Columbia.  The findings reveal a disconcerting degree of variation in approach, so much so that opposite results have been achieved in cases with relatively similar facts.  In R. v. Bouchard-Lebrun, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 575, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law.  It prescribed a legal framework for the application of the not-criminally-responsible-by-reason-of-mental-disorder defence (“NCRMD”) in cases involving substance-induced psychosis.  Significant questions remain, however, not least of which is the question of the constitutionality of the guilt-by-proxy regime embodied in section 33.1 of the Criminal Code.  More problematic is the question of whether forensic psychiatrists are in a position to provide evidence of the relative impact of substance use and underlying neurobiological factors, and whether a prevailing lack of confidence in the forensic mental health system will deter legal counsel from recommending the defence of NCRMD, even if that evidence becomes available.  The study concludes with recommendations for law reform and future research.Keywords: Substance-induced psychosis; self-induced intoxication, criminal responsibility; defence of intoxication; defence of not-criminally-responsible-by-reason-of-mental-disorder; defence of automatism; sentencingLocation: WAC Bennett Library, room 7200	Simon Fraser University

There is a variety of evidentiary sources available to policy makers, but there is increasing pressure to utilize more rigorous approaches to analyze the “complex evidence base”. I consider the need for high quality evidence including research and non-research sources, as well as quantitative and qualitative approaches. Findings from my own research, as appropriate for each level’s focus, are also discussed. I begin with the tertiary prevention level which aims to provide individuals affected by FASD continuous interventions throughout their lives so they will “not commit” and can function in the community. However due to the secondary disabilities associated with FASD, these individuals are often found within the criminal justice system. I present a comparison of individuals diagnosed with FASD found within a serious and violent offender population with those who are not diagnosed. I highlight exemplar legal cases where FASD is considered. In addition, I discuss exemplar initiatives and programs addressing the management of affected individuals. The secondary prevention level focuses on interventions to modify those environmental conditions that increase the possibility of maternal drinking. I present an extensive list of risk factors for FASD. Next I reveal four themes of intervention from the literature: screening tools, research, education, and legal strategies. With those in mind, I examine a high risk population using the existing literature on social determinants. The goal of the primary prevention level is to modify the social and environmental conditions that increase the opportunities which create individuals affected by FASD. At this level, the evidence I bring to bear are data which juxtapose medical facility locations and recorded police contacts with intoxicated persons in the same area. My findings suggest an integrated systems approach would be an effective way to identify, validate, implement, and evaluate current FASD policy and practices. By employing my tri-level prevention paradigm, it is possible to address the complexities of FASD, identify the gaps in knowledge and services, and discuss more promising policy and practical initiatives.

Moreover, theory predicts that the laws of physics make no distinction between the two. In this light, the fact that the observable universe is overwhelmingly dominated by matter is inexplicable. ALPHA is an international project located at CERN involving approximately 40 physicists from 15 different institutions in 7 countries. The primary goal of the collaboration is to study the antihydrogen atom at the highest level of precision possible, and thereby enable comparisons between hydrogen and antihydrogen. Through these comparisons it hopes to improve our understanding of the distinction between matter and antimatter, and perhaps shed some light on the puzzle of why we live in a matter dominated universe. The hyperfine energy intervals of ground-state hydrogen and antihydrogen represent an opportunity for a precision comparison. A discrepancy between the energy levels of these two atomic systems would indicate a major revolution in physics, and in our understanding of the universe. This thesis describes and interprets the first proof-of-principle spectroscopic measurements performed on magnetically trapped antihydrogen atoms. The experiments were performed by the ALPHA collaboration using microwave radiation tuned to induce transitions between hyperfine levels of ground state antihydrogen atoms. Our observations confirm that positron spin resonance transitions between hyperfine levels of ground state antihydrogen are consistent with expectations for hydrogen to within 4 parts in 10^3. The hyperfine splitting of ground state antihydrogen atoms is also constrained to 1420±85 MHz. 	Simon Fraser University

An increasingly popular approach is to cast the registration task as a graph-labelling problem and solve the problem via discrete optimization, which allows for efficient and robust registration. In this thesis, we advance registration methods in the graph-based paradigm by developing strategies to increase the model fidelity of various registration objectives and to perform their optimizations more efficiently. Specifically, we propose different ways to adapt image similarity and regularization by leveraging prior knowledge, information learned from previous examples, and information derived solely from the given input data. To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization without compromising accuracy, we also present various schemes that use contextual information or prior knowledge to conduct the solution search efficiently. To this end, we have applied our proposed methods to various deformable registration problems, as well as shape matching and contour tracking tasks with demonstrated success.Ph.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Ghassan Hamarneh, Senior SupervisorDr. Anna Celler, SupervisorDr. Richard Zhang, SupervisorDr. Purang Abolmaesumi, Internal ExaminerDr. Nikos Paragios, External ExaminerDr. Greg Mori, Chair	Simon Fraser University

This dissertation contributes to the discussion through a qualitative constructivist interpretation of regional/national news media depictions of two environmental/industrial controversies. The embroiled controversies pit concerned social actors from the Alberta communities of Marie Lake and Fort Chipewyan against Canadian oil sands proponents. Using grounded theory methods and NVivo 10 software, media depictions of the controversies were examined as indicative of the dominant voices at the intersection of a public conversation about the harms caused by the oil sands industry. Few issue entrepreneur efforts resulted in meaningful environmental reforms, but several key findings emerged.First, it is important to provide empowering eco-solutions for government, appreciating that politicians have become particularly adept at avoiding the negativity accompanying symbolically charged environmental issues. Second, there is value in embracing human-interests as a means to save nature, recognizing that social actors can appear self-serving when they attach conventional environmental concerns to anthropocentric (human-centered) causes. Third, sensationalizing isolated aspects of an environmental issue can inadvertently allow attention to be diverted from more fundamental environmental considerations. Fourth, issue entrepreneurs must remain cognizant of the ways in which ideology can defile science during an environmental controversy. Fifth, issue entrepreneurs must acknowledge that scientists are frequently ill prepared to portray their environmental findings against political ideology, and in the media where suspenseful stories routinely take precedence to nuanced and contextualized environmental stories. Sixth, it is important to depict environmental controversies in ways that cast science as only one part of a broader landscape of environmental decision-making that also acknowledges localized/first-hand experiences, and the precautionary principle. Lastly, official “truth-seeking” investigations by authoritative governmental agencies often subjugate other important avenues for understanding environmental realities.These key findings are placed in a constructivist framework entitled greener social constructions. The framework contributes to an evolving body of environmental social constructivist literature critical of ways in which journalists, policymakers, environmentalists, criminologists, and concerned publics include the environment and environmentalism in their communications. Ultimately, greener social constructions are synonymous with conceiving more compelling ways to remake the planet’s future.Location: WAC Bennett Library, room 7200	Simon Fraser University

Steven Dodge, Senior SupervisorDr. John Bechhoefer, SupervisorDr. Michael Thewalt, SupervisorDr. Frank Haran, Honeywell Process Solutions, SupervisorDr. Simon Watkins, SFU ExaminerDr. John Federici, New Jersey Institute of Technology, External ExaminerAbstractIn this work, we apply terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to measure the thickness and composition of dielectric samples consisting of multiple constituents. We accomplish this in two stages. First, a two-component model is introduced that allows us to estimate the volume fractions of two constituents in addition to the sample thickness. Here the sample is assumed to be a homogeneous mixture, with its permittivity given by the Bruggeman effective medium theory (EMT). We apply the procedure to paper samples to extract thickness and moisture content. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations with a realistic noise model to understand the parameter correlations and predict the expected uncertainties. The simulation results are consistent with the observed repeatability measurements performed on paper samples. We show that our measurements can compete with existing thickness and moisture sensors currently deployed in the industry. Second, a three-component model is presented to determine the volume fractions of three constituents, along with the thickness. We also develop two different scattering models to account for the effects of scattering from inhomogeneities. We validate our model by measuring pulp samples compressed to different thicknesses thus having variable densities. Again, our measurements match well with the independently measured parameter values. Monte-Carlo simulations suggest avenues of improvement of the performance of the system.	Simon Fraser University

It is known that a significant portion of the accesses to video sharing sites (VSSes) are now coming from OSN users. For example, YouTube reported that, as of January 2012, more than 700 tweets per minute containing a YouTube link, and over 500 years' worth of YouTube videos are watched by Facebook users every day. Although the videos shared in OSNs are mostly from VSSes, OSNs provide quite different mouth-to-mouth-like sharing mechanisms, leading to distinctive user access patterns. Yet the unique features of video sharing over OSNs and their impact remain largely unknown.In this thesis, we conduct a systematic study on the video propagation in OSNs based on large-scale realworld data. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of video requests from OSNs, showing that an OSN can dramatically amplify the skewness of video popularity that 2% most popular videos account for 90% of total views; and video popularity also exhibits much more dynamics with multiple request bursts. We then closely analyze the video propagation process in OSNs with both measurement and modeling, identifying the key influential factors. We further examine the popularity prediction of videos shared in OSNs. We demonstrate that conventional methods largely fail in this new context, and develop a novel propagation-based prediction model. Finally, based on the above studies, we present SNACS (Social Network Aware Cloud Assistance for Video Sharing), which enables OSN operators to cost-effectively enhance the video viewing experience of their users through utilizing content cloud services.Key words: social network, video sharing, popularity prediction, measurementPh.D. Examining Committee:Dr. Jiangchuan Li, Senior SupervisorDr. Qianping Gu, SupervisorDr. Jie Liang, Internal ExaminerDr. Zongpeng Li, External ExaminerDr. Mark Drew, Chair	Simon Fraser University

The focus in this Thesis is on normcompliance, analyzed as an important component of the institutional framework withinwhich decisions are made.The ?rst paper of this Thesis (Chapter 2) evaluates how norms of symmetry and centricitya?ect the functioning of two ways to allocate resources described in the economicanthropology literature, namely reciprocity and redistribution. The main conclusion of theexperimental inquiry is that reciprocity and redistribution can seldom allocate resourcese?ciently in the absence of norms of symmetry and centricity in the institutional design.The second paper of this Thesis (Chapter 3) presents an experimental investigation ofa well-known repeated network formation game. Heterogeneity and perceived similarityare found not to inuence networking choices. Players do not frequently engage in naivebest responses when transitioning from one round of play to the next in the repeated game.Although Nash networks are rare in this environment, subjects come often close to achievingan equilibrium network. Reciprocity is found to discourage naive best responses.The third paper of this thesis (Chapter 4) discusses two instruments through whichcorporate law attempts to promote trust and trustworthiness in business organizations: (i)monitoring of the manager by a principal, as in the agency approach; (ii) moral suasion, as inthe approach according to which managers are \?duciaries". A laboratory experiment showsthat the \?duciaries" language increases the investors' trust. Monitoring also increases theinvestors' trust, but only when the manager is not aware of the experimental identity of theprincipal. The manager is trustworthy up to a certain degree, regardless of the governancestructure of the organization and of the accuracy with which he/she observes each investor'sentrustment.

While crime linkage has been a burgeoning field of research for the last decade or so, a still scarce amount of research limits our knowledge on environmental consistency among serial sex offenders. Furthermore, methodological issues characterize previous studies on consistency. The current dissertation departs from previous studies in the crime linkage field by building on research coming from the criminal career field in order to move forward research on serial sex offenders’ environmental consistency and crime site selection. To this end, it is organized into three separate but related empirical studies. The first study examined consistency for specific geographic and environmental factors using various coefficients, two of them taken from the criminal career literature. While a high level of consistency was found, some environmental aspects of the crime showed better consistency than others, making them more valuable for crime linkage analysis. Findings also indicated on the bias associated with each coefficient and the potential contribution of coefficients from for criminal career field when measuring offenders’ consistency. In the second study, environmental consistency was further explored using a crime-event approach. More specifically, crime sites used by serial sex offenders were investigated across series to examine for their stability. Distinct and recurrent crimes sites used across series were identified, indicating that serial sex offenders operate over limited environments. In addition, preliminary data suggesting that a connection exists between the victim encounter site selected and the offender’s series progression was provided. More specifically, the use of sites known to “attract” potential victims decreased over series and offenders became more risk-taking in regard to sites selected to encounter their victims. In the third study, heterogeneity among serial sex offenders, with regard to offending frequency and duration, was assessed. Findings indicated that different crime series patterns were present, such patterns significantly influencing offenders’ levels of consistency. Taken together, the results of these three studies high¬lighted heterogeneity of serial sex offenders’ crime series patterns while demonstrating the relationship and stability between their past and future environmental behaviors.

The search was conducted by the ATLAS experiment on the proton-proton collisions supplied by the LHC in 2012. It is complicated by background from a mix of known processes from the Standard Model of Particle Physics. It makes use of boosted decision trees to separate the Higgs signal from the background. The gluon-gluon fusion and the vector boson fusion production mechanisms are searched for separately. The statistical significance of the excess observed over the background-only hypothesis is 3.3 standard deviations, and reaches 4.1 standard deviations when combined with other ditau channels. The observed signal appears fully compatible with the Higgs boson of the Standard Model.

In thefirst chapter, I use World War II casualties suffered in Austrian municipalities as a naturalexperiment for human casualties and find a significant negative causal effect of human losseson economic activity today. As I demonstrate, the likely channel through which the effectpersisted over time is through its impact on the structural composition of the work force.Specifically, greater human losses increased the fraction of employment in manufacturing atthe expense of agriculture until the 1970s and services from then onwards. A simple modelshows that structural change can translate a lower labor share in agricultural productioninto less participation of service sector growth at a later time.In the next chapter, I identify a channel through which the disadvantage of displacementduring a violent conflict might be carried over to the next generation. In particular, Ishow that displaced parents spend significantly less on the education of their children yearslater. A decomposition of the causal effect shows that differences in income and the stock ofdurable goods can at most explain one third of the finding. Some evidence points towardsincreased uncertainty about the future of displaced parents and hence reduced spending onnon-vital expenditure positions.The final chaper revisits the paper by Algan & Cahuc (AER, 2010) in which they find thatinherited trust has a large impact on GDP per capita. First, I show that the estimatespresented in Algan & Cahuc might be biased due to a difference between the lag structureof inherited trust and initial income in their econometric specification. Next, I focus on theirrobustness checks, where I replicate their results and document that most of their robustnesschecks fail when a programming error and data problems are corrected. I conclude that theirresults should be considered with great care.	Simon Fraser University

However, much of the explanations for these differences explicitly focus on urban populations. The result is that rural areas have been neglected. The current work seeks to explain rural concentrations of crime, with an emphasis on violent crime, through the use of an alternative to crime rates: a crime location quotient. Data were gathered from the British Columbia Policing Jurisdiction Crime Trends, 2000 – 2009 (BCPJ) and includes the raw counts of both property and violent offending from the Uniform Crime Reporting 2 (UCR2) Survey, Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Statistics Canada (N=140). A comparison between crime rates and location quotients suggests that, within British Columbia, rural areas appear to specialize in violent offending. Traditional, urban based theories are tested with ordinary least squares regression for their use in explaining property and violent offending within British Columbia and it is concluded that property offending is explained well with traditional theories although the theories are less useful for violent offending. It is speculated that the reason for this difference is that traditional theories have been developed within urban areas so might miss out on some of the specific characteristics of rural police jurisdictions. As a result, the differences between rural and urban areas and differences between rural and urban violence are identified and used to develop a rural specific theoretical construct for explaining violence. The new theoretical construct is then evaluated in terms of the empirical explanatory power along with the scope and range of the theory as it relates to British Columbia. These results are repositioned within the larger social ecological school of crime and fit back into the existing literature about rural crime. While there are limitations with focusing on a single province, important considerations for explaining rural crime are evident and suggestions for future research take into account these results.

Facile removal of residual layer from deposited silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) layer results in high fidelity of final silver electrode without further post-processes.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopic analysis have revealed residue-free transfer of microscale inter-digitated capacitors onto flexible or stretchable substrates. Enhanced adhesion with viscous UV-curable adhesive enables perfect contact between the substrate and AgNPs in the patterned trenches. As a result, adhesion between them is maximized enough to transfer AgNPs from the trenches to the target substrates. The direct stamping also leads to densification of AgNPs in the patterned trenches by pressing force for contacting the substrate and the stamp. The densification results in lower annealing temperature (~130°C) of AgNPs than normally required annealing temperature (160°C) and better mechanical stability of resulting patterns than one from other ink-based printing techniques. SEM and atomic force microscopy show highly reduced number of pores and less roughness of the layer of AgNPs as it confirms densification of AgNPs. For further understanding of the densification in the microscopic view, simulation of the direct stamping has been performed as normal pressure is applied vertically to the stamp. The simulation reveals that the layer of AgNPs extends in the normal direction to the pressure (x-direction) and is compressed in the direction of the pressure (y-direction). Extension in the x-direction provides room for AgNPs to move and compression in the y-direction densifies AgNPs. In addition, restoring force of the PDMS stamp enables further densification of AgNPs in the x-direction after removal of the normal pressure to the stamp.Finally, a table-top roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing system has been also successfully built to demonstrate high throughput manufacturing of flexible and stretchable electronic devices by the developed direct stamping method. Strain sensors, touch pads and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags have been fabricated for highly sensitive flexible and stretchable sensor applications by the R2R direct stamping with the maximum speed of 1 m/minute. The fabricated sensors are still operational even with 8 mm bending radius and after 10,000 cycles of bending. And the wireless and stretchable RFID tags have shown strain sensing behavior up to 7% of stretching strain.Keywords: Flexible electronics; stretchable electronics; roll-to-roll fabrication; silver nano-ink; direct stamping;	Simon Fraser University

The first chapter studies the effect of monopolistic competition in the presence of moral hazard on consumer welfare and the efficiency of resource allocation based on market institutions. The second chapter analyses the effect of capital market imperfections on the evolution of inequality and conflict between different socio-economic classes. The goal of this chapter is to provide a framework of the study of the effect of economic development on the dynamics of state repression. The third chapter looks at the process of development from a historical perspective and studies the effect of European colonization on contemporary economic development of former colonies. To this end, I examine the effect of colonization on genetic and non-genetic (e.g. institutional) aspects of former colonies. The broad message of this thesis is that non-market factors - historical and contemporary factors relating to social norms, beliefs, and institutions - play a crucial role in determining societies' potential for development and their prosperity.

Thought to be driven by sexually sadistic fantasies, sexual homicide is often thought to be a behavioural manifestation of sexual sadism. Known as the unique offender hypothesis much of the empirical literature on sexual homicide posits the sexual murder as severely sexually violent and qualitatively different from other types of offenders. More recently, the differential outcome of a sexual assault hypothesis has challenged the long-standing assumption that the sexual murderer is unique. It suggests that sexual homicide may be the result of a series of situational factors present during a sexual assault, and not necessarily sexual sadism. These conflicting findings reflect the theoretical and methodical issues surrounding the scientific study of sexual violence, sexual sadism, and sexual homicide. At the present time there exist few models of sexual homicide and there have been even fewer attempts to test these models empirically. Further complicating matters are the measurement and operationalization issues associated with sexual sadism.This study has three overarching goals. First, to examine the convergent and predictive validity of a series of crime scene variables empirically associated with sexual sadism. Second, to concurrently inspect the utility of both the unique offender hypothesis and the differential outcome of a sexual assault hypothesis. Finally, this study will test the theoretical factors common to prominent sexual homicide models.Overall, the results of this study demonstrated that select crime scene indicators are valid measures of sexual sadism. Moreover, sexual murderers do not constitute one homogenous group of offenders. Instead, there was evidence suggesting the unique offender hypothesis and the differential outcome of a sexual assault hypothesis are both valid. Finally, the core features of existing sexual homicide models (i.e., low self-esteem and deviant sexual preferences) are important in the prediction of sexual homicide.Keywords: Sexual Violence; Sexual Sadism; Sexual Homicide; Deviant Sexual Fantasies; Deviant Sexual Preferences; ParaphiliasLocation: Faculty Conference room, SWH 10121	Simon Fraser University

Why do some sexual assaults end in rape completion, others in injury to the victim, and still others in either both or neither of these outcomes? Why are some crimes more violent or sexually invasive than others? The current collection of studies attempts to answer these questions through analyses that delve increasingly deeper into the event of sexual assault.  A secondary analysis of correctional case files and interviews conducted with 613 sex offenders was performed using sequential logistic regression methods to determine the factors most relevant to different victim resistance patterns, violent crime outcomes, sexually intrusive crime outcomes, and combinations of particularly undesirable, tangible crime outcomes (specifically, rape completion and victim injury). Variables related to the offender’s lifestyle, disinhibitors prior to the crime, the vulnerability of the victim, situational impediments to the crime, offender modus operandi (MO), and the level of victim resistance were examined as they relate to each dependent variable. The final study goes further to provide the crime sequences most likely to lead to various outcome combinations. Implications in terms of sex crime prevention – particularly secondary prevention, or harm reduction – are discussed, with relevant suggestions for policy and education directed towards potential victims, potential offenders, and convicted sex offenders.
